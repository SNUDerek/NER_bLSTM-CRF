0,latest corporate unbundler reveals@ laid-back approach@ roland franklin who is leading@ a #m pound break-up bid for drg talks to@ frank kane
1,by frank kane
2,it seems that roland franklin the latest unbundler to appear in the uk has made@ a fatal@ error in@ the preparation of his #m break-up bid for stationery and packaging group drg
3,he has not properly investigated the target@'s dining facilities
4,the #-year-old head@ of pembridge investments through@ which the bid is being mounted@ says rule@ number one in@ this@ business is the more luxurious the luncheon rooms at headquarters@ the more inefficient the business
5,if he had taken@ his own rule seriously he would have found out that drg has a very modest@ self-service canteen at its bristol head@ office
6,there are other things@ he has on@ his own admission@ not fully investigated like the value of the drg properties or which part@ of the drg business he would keep@ after@ the break up
7,when the bid was launched@ last week mr franklin faced@ some criticism from@ city commentators on@ both those@ counts@ 
8,he regards@ the charges@ as unfounded
9,on@ property he is blunt@ 
10,i do not regard@ property profits as earnings
11,we have made@ a bid of nearly #m for a company with@ a book value of #m we've acknowledged there is some extra worth there@ but i cannot see@ the sort of value they are talking about@ in@ property
12,if they can prove it is there@ we might pay for it
13,on@ the other criticism he is equally dismissive
14,that@ point@ about@ the core business is very unfair he says
15,it is difficult to decide when you are an outsider what the business is like
16,we would eventually like to do it along with the management within@ the philosophy we will impose
17,the franklin philosophy was learnt in@ the us leveraged buyout business at@ the side@ of sir james goldsmith
18,mr franklin went there at@ the end@ of the # after@ the collapse@ of keyser ullman the merchant bank where he was a director that was rescued by the bank of england
19,he feels@ that keyser's problems were hastened by an unwise acquisition
20,he went to the us because goldsmith decided that if you wanted to be a capitalist the uk and france were not the places to be
21,along with sir james he found@ the us much more attractive@ taking over and breaking@ up@ some fairly hefty@ us corporations
22,he rejects charges@ that he was partly responsible for the casino@ atmosphere@ that gripped@ us corporate life@ in@ the early #
23,we stirred@ it up@ yes but we never lost@ any money for anybody and we never added@ to@ the unemployment figures 
24,what he has learned from@ goldsmith the only genius i have ever come@ across@ is that the holding company is not the most important unit of corporate organisation
25,the concept of the company does not interest me it's the businesses that are important
26,it does not matter whether or not drg makes@ sellotape or basildon bond it's of no consequence to@ anybody if somebody else makes them

30,letter policy and politics at@ the labour party conference
31,from mr david soskin
32,sir i was interested by your juxtaposition of poll predicts@ #-seat majority for labour with@ tories hold@ on@ # september the latter referring of course to@ the conservative victory in wandsworth the significance of which appears@ to have been almost totally ignored by the media
33,electors are always prepared@ to criticise the government in answer to pollsters' questions but when the same individuals arrive at the polling booth they simply cannot bring@ themselves to vote labour into@ power@ 
34,letter policy and politics at@ the labour party conference
35,from ms molly meacher
36,sir despite a significant gap@ in@ the labour party's education and training proposals their objective to double the number of #-#year-olds in@ full-time education must be welcomed@ # september
37,england's full-time staying-on@ rate stands@ at@ # per cent according to the latest statistics available
38,this@ compares with@ # per cent in the us # per cent in sweden # per cent in west germany and # per cent in japan
39,to add@ the part-time education and training statistics to@ those@ figures does not improve our relative position@ 
40,labour hopes@ to transform the situation@ by increasing the number of a-levels@ to@ five for the brighter@ youngsters and providing grants for four-year training courses@ two years in a further@ education college followed@ by two with@ an employer for the rest
41,these@ reforms will only achieve@ their objective if accompanied@ by the implementation of the # education act provision for compulsory partor full-time education or training up to the age of #
42,this@ clause has never yet been activated@ 
43,the sharply reduced number of #-#-year-olds will inevitably lead@ employers to bid up@ the wages of that@ age group@ to entice young people away from@ education and into@ unskilled@ or semi-@ skilled@ jobs
44,employers must be required to release@ #-#-year-olds for education and training for at least two days per week
45,only then@ will two vitally important and complementary goals@ be achieved to improve britain's general educational and vocational@ competence and hence our productive@ capacity and to reduce@ our gross educational inequalities between@ the elite who receive a narrow@ education to@ a very high@ standard@ and the rest
46,letter policy and politics at@ the labour party conference
47,from mr john pertwee
48,sir labour does not need@ a commitment to@ proportional representation in order to scoop@ most of the centre@ ground@ at@ the next@ general election
49,all it needs@ is to promise a high-powered investigation such as a royal commission into@ the practicalities of an alternative voting system@ surely justified by the intense public interest now abounding
50,such a promise would be the only hope of a breakthrough for the disenfranchised voters and would have them flocking to@ the polls for mr kinnock
51,his problem will be that mrs thatcher might decide to do it first and then she will garner the votes
52,letter policy and politics at@ the labour party conference
53,from mr denis macshane
54,sir if labour is to suggest the setting@ up@ of a specialist labour court # september then such a momentous change in@ the industrial relations system@ deserves@ more discussion and needs@ to be taken@ out of@ the hot-house@ of labour party conference politics
55,for three reasons such a move@ should be welcomed@ 
56,first it would bring@ britain into line with the best european practice notably in germany where local regional and federal labour courts handle@ problems in@ a fair@ dispassionate way@ based@ on@ law precedent and judicial expertise in@ the labour field@ 
57,second it would ensure that workers enjoyed@ positive rights@ under@ law and reduce@ the emphasis@ of union immunities@ 
58,labour law will always reflect@ the balance@ of power@ in@ society and a fully@ fledged@ labour court system@ will not remove@ class and fundamental employer-employee differences
59,but it should be possible to create and enforce enough common rules to prevent the absurd see-sawing@ of industrial relations legislation we have seen@ since #
60,third a labour division of the high@ court would contribute to@ the process of constitutional@ reform in britain which surely is to be a key political issue in@ the #
61,the trade union question would cease to haunt@ the labour party and while that@ might upset@ some conservatives it would be good for the country
62,letter independence of no-fixed@ 
63,from the rev nerissa jones
64,sir on@ saturday you published an advertisement for the # extra pages of news and features that you the independent will carry@ from@ # october
65,what do independent experts say about@ our # extra pages asks@ the advertisement
66,the supposedly jokey answers are illustrated@ by photographs of people sleeping outside covered by copies of the independent they look some@ of the hundreds@ of visitors@ who@ come@ to@ st@ botolph@'s@ crypt@ centre@ for homeless@ people@ every@ day@ 
67,given the already appalling and growing rate of homelessness and lack of hostel facilities in london when more people than ever will not only have to endure the freezing nights of the coming winter on the streets but perhaps permanent homelessness it was terrible to see the situation@ being exploited@ for a joke by your advertisement just the thing@ now the evenings are drawing@ in@ 
68, the added coverage is exactly what i wanted
69,how much independence do you suppose a person has@ who exists on@ the no-fixed-@ giro of # a week
70,letter ec immigration checks on trains
71,from the rev j gilmore
72,sir the contents@ of sarah helm's article immigration checks to be made@ on trains # september are extremely worrying
73,during the recent european community elections the representatives of ec governments promoted@ the ideal of a border-free europe by@ #
74,now it would appear@ from@ this@ article that this@ ideal is shattered@ and a two-tiered@ europe is on@ the cards@ 
75,one for those who travel by aircraft and one for those who travel by train between london and paris
76,the presence of immigration officials and police on board trains is comparable to@ the scenes@ of # america where migrant labourers were turned backat state boundaries
77,what criteria would police and immigration officials use in@ their search for potential terrorists on a train that they could not use at a static checkpoint or airport
78,do terrorists or illegal persons travel exclusively by train
79,this@ is a clear@ example of the extension@ of the prevention of terrorism act where@ criteria for stopping questioning and searching are purely subjective to@ the official involved
80,will a person's accent dress or skin colour indicate the potential terrorist or for that@ matter football hooligan or drug pusher
81,this@ is a recipe@ for fear and anxiety
82,it may mean the detention of innocent people and indeed their imprisonment
83,letter cardinal sins
84,from mr jimmy donoghue
85,sir the north-east publishers of viz are nearer@ the truth than they realise with@ their soccer strip # september
86,cardinal hume has not only the cross@ of being a fervent newcastle united supporter to bear@ he is also known to@ irreverent members@ of mayfair's jesuit farm street church by his initials george basil hume
87,latecomers who continue to hope
88,from anne applebaum in warsaw
89,dozens more east german refugees arrived outside the west german embassy yesterday seeking asylum and passage to the west including some who missed@ by@ only a few minutes a train that took@ more than # of their compatriots to west germany
90,many of the new arrivals who waited in the street outside the embassy said they were convinced there would be another train for them
91,the one they missed@ pulled@ out from warsaw's east station at@ #am yesterday carrying@ # cheering east germans bound@ for the rhine region of west germany
92,once upon@ a time another german government let lenin cross another germany in a sealed train on his way to russia
93,more than # years later lenin's heirs are allowing refugees from@ their communist regime escape in@ the opposite direction in an east german-made train travelling across east german territory
94,among those leaving was cornelia # a young east berliner destined she said for west berlin via a very circuitous route
95,i still don't know if my family know where i am or if they will suffer from@ my decision
96,but i saw@ no other way@ out@ i didn't know if i would ever have@ a chance again
97,some of the refugees had been living in@ polish exile for as long as seven weeks while others arrived only a few hours before west german diplomats announced they could leave
98,only two failed to go a new mother and her child who was born in a polish hospital four days ago
99,the east german government's decision@ to let the refugees leave across their own country came@ as a surprise to@ many including some west german diplomats
100,some of the refugees originally refused to touch east german territory again but were reassured when two of the west german diplomats said they would accompany@ the train to ensure that the rules@ were followed@ 
101,during the journey east german officials will enter the train and collect all east german passports
102,west germans will then issue new ones
103,legally the refugees have been expelled from east germany meaning that under@ current rules@ they cannot return
104,according to unofficial reports the arrangement@ was designed@ by the west german foreign minister hans dietrich genscher the new polish foreign minister krzystof skubiszewski and the soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze who met recently at the united nations in new york
105,communists allow burial of montenegro's last king
106,from marcus tanner in cetinje yugoslavia
107,the people of montenegro yesterday welcomed@ home@ the remains of nicholas i their first and last king after@ # years' exile in italy in@ belated fulfilment of his last will and testament
108,thousands of montenegrins many in national costume waited at the quayside in bar for the italian warship that would bring@ him home
109,then they formed a slow procession behind the coffin into the mountains to the old royal capital of cetinje for his reburial in the monastery there
110,what was surely the last ever montenegrin royal event was masterminded by the republic's new communist leadership which has abruptly stopped describing@ nicholas as a class enemy to ride@ the same wave@ of popular patriotism and royal fervour which swept@ serbia in@ the recent celebrations of the #th anniversary of the battle of kosovo
111,the latest biography now calls@ him an outstanding statesman warrior and man of letters
112,if i die abroad in@ exile let my body rest@ in a temporary grave until my mortal remains be transferred to our dear homeland said the montenegrin president branko kostic reading the royal will@ and testament to@ the crowds in cetinje square who carried flags and portraits of nicholas and his queen milena
113,today the people of montenegro fulfill the wish of their first and last king guided@ by innate love and respect for their history he went@ on@ 
114,our tourist organisations are counting@ on@ big@ profits said srdan darmanovic a member@ of the montenegrin central committee
115,this@ will be good for the montenegrin economy too
116,montenegro's young@ and go-ahead leadership which came@ to@ power@ this@ year amid@ furious@ popular dissatisfaction with@ the old men in grey suits sponsored the gathering of nicholas's surviving relatives the first royal reunion organised@ by a communist government
117,a letter dropped through@ the post from the president of the socialist republic of montenegro inviting me to the funeral said john kennedy a conservative party member@ who lives in barking and is a distant@ relative of nicholas
118,montenegro's sudden rehabilitation@ of nicholas's memory is a popular move@ 
119,he liberated us from@ the turks and fought for our independence said a small boy who waited at the quayside amid a jostling crowd of former monarchs visiting serbian bishops and television crews
120,marko radoman # and a veteran of both balkan wars was given@ a place at the front as one of the few with@ personal memories of nicholas's reign
121,for a man whom rebecca west a contemporary balkan observer called repulsive@ and treacherous for deserting his serbian son-in-law king alexander in@ the first world war it is a sepia-tinted@ view@ of history
122,nicholas was the uncle@ of europe for his success in@ marrying his beautiful but penniless daughters into@ the grander royal houses of russia serbia and italy
123,this@ furthered his long-term ambition to rule@ a large south slav kingdom when the ottoman empire finally collapsed@ 
124,one daughter a grand duchess of russia even gained a footnote@ in@ history by introducing an unknown monk rasputin to@ the russian tsarina alexandra
125,in his minute inaccessible capital which today has@ only # inhabitants nicholas erected a miniature european court and an exquisitely furnished victorian palace
126,he even persuaded # european powers@ to turn@ cottages into@ full embassies
127,it was a fair@ achievement in a town which an earlier observer described as # hovels
128,but nicholas's grand design@ collapsed@ in@ # when his serbian son-in-law alexander deposed him and incorporated montenegro into@ yugoslavia
129,obituary virgil thomson
130,by peter dickinson
131,virgil thomson was a composer and writer of originality courage and wit formed@ by a unique mixture@ of american and french influences
132,thomson was born in kansas city in@ # studied@ at harvard and then mostly lived in paris until@ #
133,his missouri childhood gave@ him access@ to@ baptist hymns and church music but at harvard he was introduced@ to@ the writings of gertrude stein and the music of erik satie
134,these@ influences laid@ the foundations@ for the blend@ of the naive and the sophisticated which is the hallmark@ of thomson's maturity
135,like many young american composers he studied@ with@ nadia boulanger but after@ # set@ out@ to achieve the discipline of spontaneity which he found@ in@ stein's writings
136,when he collaborated directly@ with her in@ opera the result was of historical@ significance
137,first came@ four saints in@ three acts produced in@ # and then the mother of us all # which demonstrated@ a new kind of plotless@ opera only now reaching@ a wider@ currency@ through@ the stage works of philip glass
138,in@ four saints thomson's informality was given@ free@ reign@ since he first of all improvised the music at the piano then when it stuck@ wrote it down to@ a figured@ bass
139,he said i had wondered whether a piece@ so drenched@ in@ anglican chant running@ from@ gilbert and sullivan to@ morning prayer and back@ could rise@ and sail@ 
140,but the resulting mixture@ of hymns folksy tunes and recitatives at@ times of intoxicating@ banality was a sensation@ 
141,the opera like gershwin's porgy and bess the following year used@ an all-black cast@ and the staging and choreography gave@ it a british connection@ since it was by frederick ashton
142,the mother of us all shows@ more continuity but again much depends upon@ production in@ what is still a largely non-narrative opera
143,in@ # three years before@ aaron copland thomson started writing film scores@ which were a model@ of unobtrusive clarity@ and pertinence combining american materials@ to suit@ documentaries such as the plow that broke@ the plains and the river with@ the musique d'ameublement approach@ of satie
144,his score@ for the film louisiana story was awarded@ the pulitzer prize in@ #
145,another response to@ a visual stimulus was thomson's series of musical portraits@ of people such as picasso and aaron copland
146,the first of these@ was written in@ # and they number about@ #
147,just as thomson transferred@ stein's literary abstraction to@ music so these@ portraits@ unusually employ@ the painter@'s technique@ of drawing@ the sitter@ from@ life an ideal combination of thomson's habit@ of immediate@ response with@ an actual subject@ 
148,the results are terse@ and sharply etched@ the best line@ drawings@ 
149,thomson could control@ words with@ the same fastidiousness as notes
150,he always felt@ that effective musical criticism began@ by being well written and he never lost@ his liveliness
151,one never quite knew what he was going to say next
152,he started by writing occasional articles but in@ # he wrote the state of music a trenchant and provocative assessment@ of the machinery@ of the musical profession at@ the time
153,from@ # to@ # he wrote regularly for the new york herald tribune and four volumes of his notices@ have appeared@ in@ book form@ 
154,he wrote a fulsome #-page autobiography characteristically entitled virgil thomson on@ virgil thomson and a personal survey american music since # appeared@ in@ # followed@ recently by a selected edition of his letters
155,as both composer and critic he touched@ both sides@ of the coin@ a climate@ of receptivity is what the artist most desires
156,it is also a thing@ that even the most experienced reviewer cannot always offer
157,thomson's judgements about@ music were not always as accurate as his confident expression implied he invited@ discussion
158,above@ all he restored@ the focus@ of music criticism onto@ the music itself
159,he made@ no secret of his francophile enthusiasms in@ reaction@ to@ the earlier domination of american music by germans and he was one of the first writers to register@ the importance of jazz
160,he fearlessly attacked@ convention which caused problems when he pitched@ into@ established reputations
161,it has become increasingly apparent that thomson belonged@ to@ the american experimental tradition
162,he anticipated some of the enthusiasms of john cage whom he first met in@ #
163,a few years later thomson recognised@ cage as the most original composer in america if not the world and cage repaid@ the compliment by writing the works section@ of a monograph on@ thomson
164,but finally in spite of their common roots@ in@ satie and stein thomson felt@ that cage's aesthetic was destructive@ 
165,thomson's songs contain@ some of his finest@ work
166,there are stein settings@ such as portrait@ of fb but also cycles@ such as five songs from william blake prayers and praises and a cantata based@ on@ poems by edward lear
167,thomson was also prolific@ in@ instrumental music on@ both chamber and solo scale@ 
168,for many years thomson lived in new york in his apartment at the chelsea hotel
169,from there a buzzard@ in@ its eyrie@ he would make@ forays@ round the us and abroad in spite of his advanced@ age
170,he seemed a genial and indestructible@ landmark@ in@ the history of american music in spite of defective hearing which had bothered@ him since the late seventies
171,he had a photograph of himself on his postcards and he signed his letters following@ the original tailpiece everbest
172,thomson came@ from@ a generation of american composers which had to find@ its own way@ without@ benefit of university patronage
173,in@ that@ kind of free@ market@ he thrived and survived and so will the best of his work
174,obituary thomas keller
175,by hugh matheson
176,thomi keller is the outstanding@ figure in@ the history of international rowing
177,he was president of fisa federation internationale des societes d'aviron the world governing body@ for # years and most of this@ body@'s attitudes@ and practices@ reflect@ the force@ of his strict but genial personality
178,most athletes first encountered him as a voice bellowing@ in@ multi-lingual fury at@ officials who had broken@ rules or arrangements@ designed@ to make@ racing safer or more fair@ 
179,he was elected to succeed gaston mullegg as president of fisa when he was # and still competing in the swiss rowing team
180,he did not loosen@ his links@ with@ the athletes when projected@ upwards@ into@ the presidency
181,provided their behaviour was sportsmanlike and safe oarsmen found@ only encouragement and humour from@ a president who was always among them
182,keller's zurich upbringing made@ him into@ a skiier and sculler and he raced for the grasshopper club
183,he competed for the swiss cross-country and ski-jumping team at the student winter games and later concentrated on@ single sculls
184,in@ # he was swiss sculls champion and finished third in@ the european championships before@ moving to manila to work for his family's private multinational company eduard keller ltd for four years
185,on@ his return keller was swiss champion again in@ # and was bitterly disappointed when the swiss chose to boycott the # olympics after@ the russian intervention in hungary
186,fisa was then a relatively unimportant body@ which organised@ european and other championships and participated@ in@ the running@ of olympic regattas
187,as a rich forceful young man keller had been earmarked@ as a likely future president even before mullegg was killed in@ an aircrash in@ #
188,rowing was transformed in@ the breadth@ and depth@ of participation over@ the # years of his term
189,he sat@ on@ the appropriate boards@ of the international olympic committee and was president of the general assembly of international sports federations for # years
190,these@ positions@ were not held@ for his own status@ but to promote the cause@ of rowing where@ it needed@ clout
191,he successfully defended@ rowing as an olympic sport and in@ # introduced@ women's events which have now expanded@ to@ six classes
192,his personal preference for sculling over@ rowing assisted@ the introduction of quadruple sculls to@ world championship and olympic competition
193,keller was made@ a steward of henley royal regatta in@ # a time when the proliferation of new six-lane@ still-water courses@ around the world which had emerged@ under@ his guidance@ seemed a threat@ to@ the regatta founded in@ #
194,but it was the spirit@ of henley with@ huge crowds enjoying amateur sport presented@ with@ administrative finesse which keller took@ as the yardstick@ for the international circuit@ 
195,he loved the place and he returned every year to play@ an often small part@ as umpire@ of races between@ undistinguished clubs far@ below@ the olympic standard@ he was obliged to administer
196,he said this@ summer that as he gradually wound down his involvement in@ sport henley would be the last thing@ he would give up
197,during his term as president of fisa he gradually reduced@ his role@ in@ eduard keller ltd and used the company offices to provide a world headquarters@ for rowing
198,the sport is now obliged@ to find@ income from@ the more normal sources@ of television and sponsorship to replace@ his largely unacknowledged private patronage
199,in spite of his gift to@ the sport keller was anxious not to abuse@ his status as president and never went to a rowing event unless invited
200,because of this@ he had never seen the oxford and cambridge boat race until@ this@ year
201,he was enthralled by the entire proceeding and remarked that only the english could make@ a contest between@ two crews which would not rank@ in@ the world's top@ # into@ a bigger@ spectacle than the olympic final
202,the final task he set@ himself for his presidency which was due to end next year was to weed@ out of@ the regatta calendar all the rowing courses@ which could be made@ unfair@ by the wind
203,he had recently travelled from tasmania to norway in search of the perfect # metres of flat water
204,it was a blessing that in response to congratulations on@ the superb world championship regatta at bled in yugoslavia three weeks ago he was able to reply yes and best of all the conditions were fair@ throughout@ 
205,the labour party conference policy review throws@ a spanner@ in@ the whitehall machinery@ 
206,by colin hughes political correspondent
207,an incoming@ labour government would turn@ large areas of whitehall upside down@ but the party's policy review barely considers@ the implications of its plans@ for restructuring government departments
208,scattered@ through@ the policy review are proposals to drastically alterthe status@ and organisation of the department of trade and industry create two departments a department of consumer affairs and a department for legal administration create a department of environmental protection within@ the existing department of the environment set@ up@ a plethora of new commissions and executive agencies set@ up@ a women's ministry
209,those@ are only the most overt changes advocated in@ the review papers
210,the only department which explicitly escapes@ unscathed is the one which conservatives would most like to abolish the department of energy
211,in@ virtually every case the aim@ of causing upheaval is explicitly declared because labour's aim@ would be to upset@ the bureaucratic order@ it inherits@ 
212,new departments and quangos would according to the review be designed@ to act@ as irritants@ and antagonists within@ the civil service system@ 
213,but the policy review nowhere@ considers@ the overall effect of the individual changes proposed or how they might be co-ordinated@ 
214,nor does it contemplate@ the knock-on consequences for labour ministers of attempting to implement their programme while rebuilding@ the governmental machine@ 
215,the medium term industrial strategy which would form the centrepiece@ of labour's economic policy would according to the productive and competitive economy review group be administered by a transformed department of trade and industry
216,the review adds@ what we now seek@ is a dti which will have@ an equal if not superior status@ to that@ of the treasury
217,that@ approach@ would seek@ to knock@ out@ a keystone@ of civil service tradition
218,labour policy has long sought@ to challenge@ the treasury's dominance in@ government
219,but its last effort the department of economic affairs set@ up@ by harold wilson and headed@ by george brown ended in@ futile departmental and ministerial infighting
220,there would in addition be a minister for science and technology at@ the newly supreme@ dti with@ responsibility for determing@ investment in@ research
221,there is no mention@ in@ the education policy of how that@ might affect the department of education and science
222,but while the dti would override@ the treasury a new powerful@ department of consumer affairs would antagonise@ the dti
223,it would be headed@ by a minister of cabinet rank@ and act@ as the consumers voice@ with@ other government departments'
224,its remit for inter-departmental intrusion@ would be wide@ with@ a watching@ brief@ over@ government action and the ability@ to initiate consumer legislation
225,only the women's ministry would be given@ equal license
226,it would be able@ to require@ each government department to review its policies practices and existing and proposed legislation
227,while new departments are born@ and others extended@ one of the oldest@ the home office would become a shadow@ of its present@ self@ 
228,labour's proposed department for legal administration would take@ over@ responsibility for courts and tribunals court procedures organisation training and appointment of the legal profession magistracy and judiciary legal aid legal services and the sentencing council
229,that@ would leave@ the home office with@ policing penal policy and the criminal law
230,responsibility for the sex discrimination act the equal pay act and the equal opportunities commission would be given@ to@ the women's ministry
231,the concept of a minister having@ cabinet rank@ and therefore implicitly not being a member@ of the cabinet proper@ crops up again on@ environment
232,a new minister of environmental protection would operate@ inside@ the doe
233,that@ could work@ though it is easy to imagine conflicts@ of interest@ with@ the housing and planning functions of the department
234,more problematic will be labour's plan@ for the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food

244,the labour party conference cook appeals for labour to accept@ electoral reform
245,by colin hughes and colin brown
246,an impassioned appeal for labour to back@ electoral reform was made@ by a leading@ shadow@ cabinet member@ yesterday after the national executive decided@ overwhelmingly to oppose@ a proportional representation motion
247,robin cook a member@ of the national executive and the health spokesman said that a labour government which sought@ to force@ its programme on@ an unwilling nation would be unsocialist
248,he told a labour co-ordinating@ committee rally that it was not enough for labour to win the next election
249,it would also be necessary to smash@ the decrepit@ effete@ constitution@ that allows@ a minority to capture@ power@ and then use@ it ruthlessly in@ the interests@ of the privileged few
250,mr cook argued that # years of thatcherism had been forced@ on@ most people who had never voted conservative and that many of those who opposed pr in@ the labour party wanted to use the same undemocratic power@ to ram@ socialism down@ the throats@ of a majority who didn't vote for it
251,advocates of the first-past-the-post system@ argued that it was the only way@ of delivering@ strong@ government mr cook said
252,but after@ # years of tory rule he had had@ enough@ of that@ approach@ to@ politics
253,labour would be acquiescing@ in@ a democratic outrage if it continued arguing@ that because the conservatives had got@ awaywith being undemocratic for so long@ it was now labour's turn@ 
254,mr cook also countered the argument that pr would build@ in@ a pull@ towards@ the centre@ ground@ preventing labourfrom@ implementing a radical@ programme
255,it seemed strange to make@ that@ argument mr cook said when it was clear@ the whole@ policy review process was designed@ to placate the centre@ ground@ 
256,i cannot honestly see@ that a system@ which would require us to compromise the morning after@ the election is really so morally inferior@ to@ a system@ which has already obliged@ us to compromise our policies two years before@ polling day
257,his speech however came@ aftera #-# vote in@ the national executive to oppose a proportional representation motion which will be debated on@ thursday
258,the four were mr cook ken livingstone john evans and clare short
259,mr livingstone said he was against@ pacts but # years of thatcherism had demonstrated@ the dangers of giving@ power@ to@ elites
260,however neil kinnock the labour leader and roy hattersley his deputy both opposed the motion
261,mr hattersley said giving@ disproportionate power@ to@ small minority centre@ parties would not improve democracy
262,mr kinnock said it was wrong to propose a fundamental change in@ the voting system@ for a short-term tactical@ vote to get@ rid@ of the thatcher government
263,the only way@ to remove@ the government was for labour to win the next general election
264,mr kinnock intends to reinforce@ his conviction@ that labour is in@ a position@ to win in@ his keynote speech tomorrow
265,party organisers want the conference to show@ that the party is united as never before@ leaving@ mr kinnock free@ for the first time to sell@ the policy package@ to@ voters without@ worrying about@ splits@ 
266,there is expected to be a close@ vote on@ defence but mr kinnock is confident the new policy will be affirmed today
267,the executive is recommending@ rejection of a motion calling@ for unilateral disarmament
268,it is also urging@ the conference to oppose@ a motion supported@ by the national union of mineworkers to commit@ a labour government to@ abolishing all nuclear power@ within@ # years
269,there could also be controversy over@ the executive's rejection@ of demands for the age of consent for homosexuals to be reduced@ to@ # years

325,ripping yarns and moral@ minefields@ allan and janet talk ahlberg talk to@ celia dodd about@ their bestsellers for children
326,by celia dodd
327,these@ days no one questions the importance of good books for the under-@ 
328,but books that appeal@ to@ adults too are just as important we are after@ all the ones who have to do the reading
329,there are few things@ worse than being bludgeoned@ into@ reading a book you hate
330,story-reading should be one of the great joys of parenthood a real meeting@ of adult and child minds
331,with@ the ahlbergs' books it very often is
332,the husband-and-wife partnership behind@ such classics as the jolly postman burglar bill and the baby's catalogue win@ children over@ with@ ripping yarns and a wicked@ sense of humour
333,they win their parents over with a rose@ -tinted@ vision of the world which is decidedly reassuring@ 
334,their books are usually set@ nostalgically in@ the past the thirties and forties are favourite periods and often feature the perennial@ characters@ of fairy tales and nursery rhymes
335,yet they are saved@ from@ sentimentality by the wry humour of both text and pictures
336,the ahlbergs have been accused of not facing up to the harsh@ realities of life of being too cosy and sweet@ but their latest picture book bye bye baby published today breaks@ the mould@ 
337,in@ it a small child roams the streets talking to@ strangers until he finally goes off with a woman who has been wandering about pushing an empty pram
338,curious@ subject matter for a children's picture book you might think and hardly guaranteed to win@ the approval of the gimlet@ -eyed@ children's book world@ 
339,but the ahlbergs have@ no time for literal interpretations of their work
340,how they argue would alice or the wind in the willows stand@ up@ against@ such scrutiny
341,the way@ to look@ at@ bye bye baby they insist is as a light@ surreal comedy
342,certainly if you bring@ a literal interpretation to@ the story it's a minefield@ allan ahlberg says
343,bye bye baby gets@ away@ with@ its particular minefield@ thanks to the sleight of illustrator janet ahlberg's hand
344,the visual inspiration for the book was the famous advert for start-rite shoes showing@ a small boy and girl walking off down a tree-lined@ avenue an innocent@ image if ever there was one
345,the ahlberg version features a solitary figure
346,the advert gave@ the story its vaguely thirties setting
347,the success of the ahlbergs' working relationship must have a lot to do with@ their long@ and happy@ marriage
348,in spite of apparently incompatible personalities she is small and shy he is large and does most of the talking they have@ an empathy which is essential to@ the way@ they work a persistent mutual pestering
349,the strength@ of the partnership is highlighted@ for allan who also works with a number of other artists
350,the time-consuming nature@ of janet's part@ in@ the process combined@ with@ a bad back which prevents her spending@ more than a couple of hours at the drawing board every day means she cannot keep up with her husband's prolific@ output
351,with other illustrators i work at@ a distance we visit and phone but there is a point@ at@ which i can't pester them any more allan says
352,they see@ themselves not as author and illustrator with@ separate roles@ but as a partnership of book-makers contributing equally to@ the process
353,allan ahlberg says in@ the past a lot@ of children's books seemed to be the work of talented illustrators whose pictures looked brilliant@ framed in a gallery but when you tried to read the book there was nothing there@ because the words started@ a coat-hanger@ to hang@ pictures@ on@ 
354,given the importance they place@ on@ the interrelationship of words and pictures the couple's working lives are surprisingly separate
355,they claim@ to see each other less than couples who go out to work meeting for the occasional cup of coffee in the kitchen
356,their #-year-old daughter jessica who is likely to be seen with her head buried@ in@ the beano or a roald dahl novel has provided the inspiration for many of her parents' books
357,as a baby she was fascinated by the mothercare catalogue and so the baby's catalogue which documents the paraphernalia of the infant's small world@ in@ minute detail was born@ 
358,allan's experience as a primary school teacher is another rich@ source@ of ideas
359,the couple still maintain@ close@ links@ with@ local schools where they spend@ hours researching sketching and absorbing@ jokes
360,after@ # years of teaching allan had had@ enough
361,i ran@ out of@ steam@ 
362,it's a killing@ job
363,little kids eat@ you alive they want so much physically and emotionally
364,every year he would have half@ a dozen nineand #-year-olds in his class who could barely read
365,he treated reading as a team effort getting@ them to read the daily mirror rather than the dull babyish books on@ offer
366,these@ days he writes the books intended to help children learn to read
367,a lot@ of books used in schools are technically readable but rather drab stories
368,there's no reason why they shouldn't be funny or gripping even if they don't use@ many words
369,writing books for children is becoming increasingly complex as the arbiters of the modern child's mores librarians teachers and publishers lay@ down@ ever more stringent criteria
370,the problem with@ children's books increasingly is that there are armies@ of people who are properly concerned with@ for example the way@ girls were always discriminated against@ in@ the past says allan
371,that@ is bad and must be thought about@ 
372,but people seem to think that stories are written to@ a prescription@ that you sit down and say you don't want it to be sexist you don't want it to be racist
373,in@ reality you just invent a tale you@ were sitting@ round@ a fire@ in@ a cave@ 
374,in@ fact anti-racism and anti-sexism seem to come@ naturally to@ the ahlbergs
375,their books are full@ of female breadwinners and new men changing nappies and comforting bawling babies in@ the small@ hours
376,although they are a principled pair@ they once turned@ down@ the smarties award on@ moral grounds@ the ahlbergs reject the notion of children's author as moralist
377,i would say just sit down and tell a good story and to hell with@ the morality allan ahlberg declares
378,with@ that@ characteristically strong@ statement he puts@ his finger@ on@ the secret of the ahlbergs' phenomenal success with@ adults and children alike
379,the revolution@ the countryside needs christian wolmar says britain is lagging@ behind@ in@ setting@ up@ telecottages
380,by christian wolmar
381,the information technology revolution@ has left@ large swaths of rural britain untouched@ 
382,the only computers in many villages are those@ owned by the teenage boys of the affluent to play their wham-bam games
383,ashley dobbs an engaging young entrepreneur is setting@ out@ to change@ that@ by creating a nationwide network of telecottages
384,this@ clever@ name with@ its neat@ evocation of new and old describes@ a concept which was developed in sweden and is spreading@ to@ rural areas across the world
385,in@ mr dobbs's words a telecottage is a room in a village filled with computer communications that can be used by local people to learn and work
386,the equipment consists of perhaps four word processors a modem a laser printer able to produce artwork-quality output a fax and a photocopier
387,software programmes for desk-top publishing word processing accounting and business planning are also essential
388,mr dobbs who is chairman of telecottages uk warns possible users not to get bogged@ down@ with@ the technology the equipment is a tool to overcome@ what needs to be done
389,people mustn't think that because there's a computer they've got to think of a use for it
390,he reckons@ there are no shortages of possible uses farmers can use it to do their accounts women with@ child-care responsibilities can work in@ their own time on the word processors publicity material@ for local craftsmen can be produced@ and so on
391,this@ may sound utopian but it has been borne out by the experience of existing telecottages
392,so far@ about@ # have been established mainly in scandinavia but also in japan and several third world@ countries
393,as the network expands@ so do the uses 
394,the first was opened@ in the village of vemdalen in the remote forests of sweden in@ september #
395,the impact@ according to henning albrechsten president of telecottages international who has been involved in@ their development since the outset was immediate@ 
396,by holding@ open@ meetings for children and having the telecottage above the local store people of all walks@ of life came in small-scale entrepreneurs and their spouses shop assistants craftspeople and children
397,now # per cent of the village regularly@ uses@ telecottage and at least # per cent has taken@ courses@ there 
398,britain is lagging@ behind@ 
399,no telecottages have been established but there are several initiatives in@ the offing
400,the most advanced is a plan@ for five in@ the north of scotland which will be funded by the highlands and islands development board and british telecom
401,colin pavey of british telecom hopes that they will be running@ by@ the end@ of the year
402,two would be business@ and three would be community-orientated and located in schools
403,we are most interested in@ the idea of networking sharing@ skills such as translation and using them for distance learning
404,telephone cables in the region are being upgraded to ensure they are capable@ of handling@ faxes
405,mr dobbs's more unlikely allies@ are the women's institutes
406,most of the workers in telecottages and many of the users are women
407,he says in villages there are many women with@ skills who aren't using them because of child-care problems
408,but they are interested in@ working
409,users of telecottages are given the key and people can use them at@ any time which means that women can come in during the evening early in@ the morning or whatever
410,he is working on@ a scheme with@ the national federation of wi to organise a competition to celebrate next year's #th anniversary by offering # telecottages as prizes for its # branches@ and he is hoping the wi will establish a pilot telecottage near its college in denman oxfordshire
411,while telecottages should become self-financing once established they do need initial subsidy
412,the cost of providing the start-up equipment is in the order of # and mr dobbs thinks space is not much of a problem there's usually the village hall or an empty shop
413,henning albrechsten reckons@ that it takes@ three years for a telecottage to be able@ to function without@ subsidy
414,in scandinavia with@ their mixed@ economies money is always available after@ a bit@ of persuasion from@ both local and central@ government
415,in britain the tight@ financial regime imposed on@ local councils and the reluctance@ of central@ government to take@ on@ any new expenditure makes@ it necessary to seek funds from@ the private sector@ 
416,the only government support@ so far@ has been a recommendation by the rural development commission part@ of the department of the environment to establish a pilot scheme
417,mr dobbs sighs this@ is a typically british bureaucratic response@ 
418,it's been proved elsewhere that they work@ 
419,we don't need pilots@ we need telecottages
420,as for the private sector@ while bt may be happy@ to provide pump@ priming@ for five telecottages in@ the north of scotland it is not about@ to bankroll@ a nationwide network
421,nor it seems is anyone else
422,there is more at@ stake@ here@ than just bringing boxes of sophisticated@ equipment to remote areas
423,as mr dobbs who runs@ a country house restoration business@ from@ his home in micheldever hampshire says villages are good places to live and work
424,the village is a fantastic@ institution and they make@ people happier
425,but the villages are dying@ becoming suburbs or dormitories@ where few people work but many sleep 
426,employment in@ agriculture still the main rural industry fell@ from@ over@ a million in@ the mid-sixties to@ under@ # now
427,the aim@ of telecottages is to create well-paid flexible@ employment which will provide new jobs and make@ existing rural industries more competitive
428,the emphasis@ on@ high@ wages is important
429,villages are expensive to live in and if they are to become vibrant communities again local people must be able to earn enough to be able to continue living in them
430,there is a wider@ impact@ too
431,the abstract talk@ of commuting by rail or road being replaced@ by information technology finds@ a concrete@ expression in@ the idea of telecottages
432,once people overcome@ their fears about@ computers and begin to use them in telecottages they acquire their own equipment
433,many may eventually be able to work from@ home rather than commute to an office
434,henning albrechsten says modern information technology has given@ people in remote regions the opportunity to overcome@ their worst handicap@ their distance from the centres@ of learning and development
435,he sees@ them as not only strengthening@ small communities but also as actually beginning to reverse@ the population flows@ from the countryside to the towns
436,britain with@ its growing@ traffic problems seems an ideal place for the onset of this@ revolution@ 
437,despite mr dobbs's tireless@ efforts this@ is another revolution@ which britain is likely to be viewing@ from@ the sidelines@ 
438,rugby union welsh horizon@ all turns black@ 
439,by steve bale
440,each new indignity in@ the heap@ visited@ on@ welsh rugby seems worse than the last
441,the selectors knew they were playing@ with@ fire@ when they decided to arrange@ a couple@ of club fixtures@ and they have duly been consumed@ in@ a conflagration@ of their own making@ 
442,the new zealanders appropriately garbed in funereal black arrive next week to scatter@ the ashes@ 
443,on and off the field the national game of the land of song is in@ a discordant@ mess@ 
444,losing@ was one thing@ but to lose@ as spinelessly@ as the welsh xv did to@ bridgend on@ saturday was to add@ insult to@ severely injured@ pride
445,in@ all honesty we should have won by@ at least # points@ brian nicholas the bridgend coach@ said
446,as if #-# and derisive chants@ of easy easy were not bad enough this@ humiliation was against@ a side@ who have made@ a wretched@ start to@ the season a week earlier pontypool had given@ them a #-# going@ over@ and were short@ of at least half@ first-choice players
447,four of the absentees suffered the squirming@ discomfort@ of being among the welsh squad@ 
448,it's not that i don't want to say anything but i just don't know what to say john ryan the welsh coach@ sighed
449,his plans@ in@ ruins@ he is now reduced@ micawber@ to@ hoping something will turn@ up@ before his players face@ the all blacks in@ five short@ weeks
450,at bridgend he looked in@ despair and he almost admitted@ as much i hope we can pull it together but sometimes i have@ my doubts
451,nicholas was sympathetic he is only as good as the players we give@ him
452,but another selector confided the truth that wales should be giving@ club opposition a hammering@ and at@ half@ building@ on@ their win over@ newbridge it looked@ as if they would
453,they had weathered@ bridgend's early fury@ conceding@ a try before@ coming@ back@ with@ some confidence to score@ three of their own
454,but wales were having@ us on@ 
455,from@ the comparative opulence of #-# they then slipped@ into@ penury@ by conceding # unanswered@ points@ 
456,bridgend raised@ their game against@ wales now wales must do precisely the same against@ new zealand
457,no one who was at the brewery field perhaps not even the selectors would give@ twopence@ for their ability to do so
458,the backs@ were mainly pedestrian@ but the fundamental problem lay@ elsewhere@ 
459,apart from kevin moseley's steady@ supply@ from@ the line-out there was nothing much to commend@ in@ a welsh forward effort which reverted@ to@ the very worst eighties stereotype of static cumbersome donkeys@ only too willing to slow the game to@ walking pace
460,when the pressure@ comes@ on@ players revert to@ bad habits@ ryan said
461,the all blacks would treat such an outmoded approach@ with@ the scorn it deserves@ although on@ the other hand@ they might have been impressed with@ bridgend's contrasting mobility@ and aggression@ 
462,the back row were swifter@ to@ the loose@ ball had@ a clearer@ idea of what to do with it when they got there@ and their impressive half-backs were given@ every opportunity which they eagerly took@ to control@ the game
463,this@ was conveniently encapsulated@ in@ the first try
464,wales characteristically delayed@ the heel at@ a scrum putting@ robert jones in@ trouble when the ball finally emerged
465,he was scraggedby mike budd jeremy cooper came away with the ball owain williams acted as the link@ and kevin ellis scored@ three back-row forwards and their scrum-half@ in@ perfect harmony@ 
466,wales's instant reaction@ a try by arthur emyr and subsequent steady@ improvement bringing@ well-crafted@ tries for emyr and robert jones promised@ more than was later fulfilled
467,in@ the third quarter@ bridgend had@ little difficulty in@ wiping@ out@ an #-point@ deficit huw bevan supporting@ aled williams's break@ for their second try
468,it was a magnificent fightback and such was welsh distress@ that they never looked like preventing it
469,we have taken@ a step@ backward@ ryan said and on@ this@ sorry@ evidence it looks@ as if it will be backwards@ all the way@ when the test takes@ place@ at cardiff arms park on@ # november
470,as the welsh squad do not meet again until@ # october time has all but run@ out@

479,bobby robson was there to assess@ world cup candidates but nothing positive emerged@ from@ # minutes of scuffling@ that made@ one almost yearn for the more measured boredom of rangers' european cup exit@ in munich three days earlier
480,at least the outcome was appropriate
481,had either of the teams won@ they would have taken@ the league leadership@ 
482,instead liverpool stayed@ top@ without@ kicking a ball
483,television had postponed@ manchester united's scheduled visit@ to anfield so it could be shown live@ on@ # december the longest@ night
484,london's leading@ pair as if piqued@ by this@ turned@ # september into@ the longest@ afternoon
485,on@ and on@ it dragged@ 
486,lacking a goal that might have altered its chemistry@ it remained a matter of dull@ physics@ 
487,yet many of the crowd were kept@ interested by the possibility of victory which is i suppose what derbies are about@ 
488,they are so frequent these@ days in london which has@ eight of # first division clubs that we must expect aesthetic considerations to be overridden
489,why though could these@ supposed championship contenders not have tried to emulate the fine@ passing@ that had sprinkled@ the previous weekend's merseyside joust@ 
490,the simple@ answer@ is that chelsea are in@ a false position@ and arsenal on@ this@ evidence slightly jaded champions
491,they ought to have pocketed@ three points@ in@ the first half@ but tony adams a more threatening centre-forward on@ his forays@ than the current alan smith missed the target with@ two headers and david rocastle let dave beasant save@ a penalty much as the stretch@ keeper@ had done for wimbledon in@ the # fa cup final
492,now an arsenal team in@ peak@ health@ would have kept@ a grip@ on@ the match
493,this@ one could not
494,as george graham indicated@ upon@ his side@'s accession@ to@ the title@ they would need more composure and sophistication to match liverpool in@ the longer@ term
495,he chose not to hasten the process by buying
496,after@ all he had@ just the man on@ his staff
497,but paul davis remains unfit
498,his absence is increasingly conspicuous and liverpool for the moment in@ a super league of one
499,davis of course would have walked@ into@ england's team in poland a week on@ wednesday until@ last season's prolonged suspension@ followed@ by injury bobby robson had@ him firmly@ pencilled in as bryan robson's replacement
500,michael thomas several years younger is not quite in@ the same class@ yet but may have to play in chorzow
501,if so it will be a gamble because he flopped@ on@ his only previous international appearance in saudi arabia
502,the odds are favourable enough according to chelsea's mike hazard who said of his adversary he could cope in poland not just because of his ability to close@ people down@ and use the ball well but temperament you saw@ when he scored the goal that won@ arsenal the league
503,very kind but international players are supposed to be habitually influential and it was hazard who in@ the second half@ with@ a few incisive passes gifts@ from@ the heavens@ on@ a day like this@ left@ a greater@ mark@ 
504,chelsea might have won@ had the ball not kept@ turning@ into@ a mexican bean@ at kerry dixon's feet
505,campbell's hard-working@ side@ are still trying@ to sort@ out@ their system@ which involves a spare@ defender and as far@ as one can see@ a good deal@ of improvisation
506,it should suit@ tony dorigo the unblooded england left-back@ though oddly his rival nigel winterburn did more rampaging on@ saturday neither in@ truth made@ the heart@ pound@ 
507,dorigo at least had@ the satisfaction of seeing his direct@ opponent and england colleague david rocastle withdrawn@ 
508,all in@ all bobby robson must have found@ it about@ as fruitful@ as a day trying to get@ in touch with brian clough
509,there was however one aspect@ that deserves@ commendation
510,after@ # minutes graham roberts was injured by a tackle for which perry groves was booked steve clarke took over as sweeper@ and is likely to have@ several weeks in@ which to build@ on@ a promising display@ 
511,roberts's ankle appeared broken but the chelsea players were not interested in@ retribution and the club as soon as they knew@ the injury was less serious@ put@ a message on the electronic scoreboard an example of public relations from@ which others could learn

513,from@ andrew brown religious affairs correspondent in rome
514,the archbishop of canterbury dr robert runcie exchanged@ a symbolic kiss of peace with pope john paul ii yesterday at@ a mass attended by thousands in st peter's square rome
515,but dr runcie's ideas of a limited primacy recognising the pope as a central@ figure in@ the christian church who would exercise@ a primacy for the sake of unity and mission have been rejected as insufficient by the pope
516,they have also aroused@ protestant anger against@ dr runcie at@ the same time as he has become involved in@ a row over@ his attack@ on@ the pharisees@ of british society
517,though dr runcie and his party could not take@ holy communion at@ the papal mass he had earlier celebrated the eucharist at the anglican church in rome after three demonstrators rose from the congregation as he ascended the pulpit the visit has been dogged@ by protests from@ supporters of the rev ian paisley
518,in@ his sermon dr runcie said we should ever recognise the scandal that anglicans and roman catholics must celebrate two eucharists to make@ one memorial of our redemption on@ the day of our lord@ 
519,dr runcie has gone@ out of@ his way@ on@ this@ visit to concede many of the doctrinal points@ and practices which large@ elements@ of the church of england have traditionally found@ offensive in@ roman catholicism
520,the pope too has spoken warmly@ of unity
521,on@ saturday the two prelates attended a service@ of vespers at the church of san gregorio which stands@ on the site where pope gregory sent st augustine of canterbury off to become the first archbishop of canterbury in@ #
522,but in@ their prepared homilies the pope and the archbishop addressed@ quite different problems
523,dr runcie repeated his offer of a limited primacy involving the limited powers@ exercised@ by the popes in@ the first few centuries of the christian church
524,however the pope's account@ of the role@ of the papacy went@ a great deal farther@ than that@ christian unity he said must be founded@ on@ the faith in@ christ that was handed@ on@ by the apostles what this@ faith is must be determined by the roman catholic church
525,he quoted the second vatican council the task of giving@ an authentic interpretation of the word of god has been entrusted to@ the living teachting@ office of the church alone@ 
526,the specific role@ of bishops which is to be exercised@ in@ communion@ with@ the see@ of peter in@ ensuring the unity and continuity of the faith is vital@ if we are to hand@ on@ the faith of peter gregory and augustine
527,all our efforts to restore@ unity among christians will be in vain if they are not carried out in@ total fidelity to@ the faith in@ christ handed@ on@ by the apostles
528,in@ a statement afterwards dr runcie stressed@ that he was not proposing any change@ in@ the british constitution@ 
529,the phrase universal primacy has@ a spiritual meaning
530,it does not imply political supremacy and does not suggest that the pope should administer the affairs of the church of england he said
531,both prelates referred to@ the consecration in@ february of the rt rev barbara harris as the anglican assistant bishop of massachussetts
532,bishop harris is quite unacceptable to@ the vatican

537,labour would keep@ tight@ rein@ on@ spending
538,by anthony bevins political editor
539,john smith the shadow@ chancellor yesterday set@ the overriding tone@ for this@ week's labour party conference with@ a warning that he would impose tough@ spending controls@ if labour won@ the next@ election
540,his warning casts@ doubt on@ labour's commitment to increase spending on@ priority programmes for the health service and pensions
541,mr smith said in@ an interview on@ bbc television's on@ the record that he did not expect his colleagues to spend and spend again' when they took@ office
542,he conceded that there would be disputes with@ colleagues but said there are no quick@ fixes@ and i will not be indulging in@ any quick@ fix@ 
543,a quick@ fix@ clearly becomes unfixed@ 
544,there are realities that i cannot change@ 
545,there will be the reality of the economic situation@ which we inherit@ which will not be our fault but it will be our responsibility
546,when we've@ got@ an economic mess@ the first duty of a government is to clear@ up@ the economic mess@ 
547,now if that@ means@ we have to postpone some of our social ambitions then we may have to do so
548,but it will not mean@ that we are abandoning@ them
549,we will tackle@ putting@ our economy in@ order@ so that we can achieve that@ social ambition so that the strong@ economy is used to finance and develop the fair@ society
550,as for his colleagues mr smith said we're all agreed that we cannot spend what we have not earned and we intend to earn it before we spend it
551,that@ will be the guiding@ light@ of the next@ labour government
552,when i insist on@ that@ priority as i can tell you i most certainly will with@ the full@ support@ of the prime minister in@ doing so then i'm sure my colleagues will see@ the point@ of that@ 
553,now it is quite right of them of course to allow our social obligations not to be forgotten there'll probably be an argument
554,there are in@ all governments between@ the treasury and spending ministers
555,but they will take@ into@ account@ the need for that@ balance@ that says@ that social spending without@ underpinning@ by economic growth@ will not be sustained@ in@ any event
556,mr smith's warning coincided with@ a call by ken livingstone the labour mp for brent east who said on@ london weekend television's the walden interview you can be miles@ ahead@ in@ the polls but when you get@ to@ the last three weeks people think can i afford@ a labour government
557,we need to say now what we are going to spend where the money is going@ to come@ from@ 
558,mr livingstone called@ for@ cuts@ in@ defence spending
559,david blunkett another member@ of the national executive told a conference fringe@ rally organised@ by the soft@ labour coordinating committee that labour would have to find additional funds for its social programme by cutting@ #bn from@ defence spending over@ five years and raising@ the level@ of taxation on@ the rich
560,the policy review's top@ rate of income tax # per cent was too low@ he said
561,although the policy review will be endorsed@ by the conference giving@ neil kinnock the freedom to go@ on@ to@ the offensive@ against@ the conservatives in@ the run-up@ to@ the next@ general election there are a number of areas@ of potential conflict
562,calls for consideration of electoral reform@ and a new form@ of black representation are both expected to be defeated@ 
563,ron todd the general secretary of the transport workers' union said that today's vote on@ the multilaterist nuclear defence policy would not yield@ the massive@ and overwhelming majority predicted by right-wingers@ and he warned that party leaders could not expect everybody to goose-step@ in@ the same direction@ once the policy had been carried@

565,an atmosphere@ poisoned@ by mistrust
566,by nicholas roe
567,the disposal of toxic wastes is one of the most intractable@ problems facing@ industrialised societies
568,even though some of the most dangerous and persistent@ toxins including polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs are no longer manufactured quantities of them still exist and must be got@ rid of
569,but how
570,and where
571,on@ this@ page nick roe visits a plant@ which despite strenuous public relations efforts has failed@ to convince@ its neighbours that it has come@ clean@ 
572,and richard north looks@ at@ current provisions for the destruction of pcbs and at@ the history of british involvement in@ a rather uncomfortable@ growth industry the security guard at the entrance to one of britain's mightiest hazardous waste disposal plants@ pressed a button and the gate opened
573,then he pressed another knob and a big toy doll in his office window dropped@ its trousers
574,you had to laugh
575,yet this@ was rechem international's high@ incineration plant@ at pontypool in gwent south wales
576,hardly a laughing matter surely
577,beyond the barrier lay@ some of the most toxic chemicals known awaiting@ destruction by fire
578,what else
579,a vast smoke-blackened furnace # people to do the work massive@ investment the company spent@ #m last year on@ cleaning up smoke emissions
580,plus a backdrop@ of houses covering@ the valley walls@ on either side a reminder that wherever industrialised societies decide@ to deal@ with@ their most intractable@ problems they are unlikely to find@ a place to do so which is not in somebody's back@ yard@ 
581,britain grinds@ out@ almost five million tonnes of hazardous waste each year of which about@ # tonnes are so difficult to store or treat that they are burnt at@ high@ temperatures here in gwent or at one of three other centres@ ellesmere port fawley near southampton and the unfortunately named killamarsh near sheffield
582,five more incinerators currently proposed in various parts of the country will double capacity
583,then there are the imports # tonnes of toxic waste enter british ports annually for incineration or other treatment a figure which has increased #-fold in@ just eight years
584,in@ these@ environmentally conscious@ times this@ is an uncomfortable@ growth industry
585,liverpool dockers recently turned back parts of a #-tonne consignment of canadian pcbs polychlorinated biphenyls bound@ for this@ plant@ in gwent
586,in@ doing so they underlined@ a fact which is likely to attract@ more and more attention as tankers continue to shift toxins from town to town country to country the waste chain@ is long@ 
587,it snakes in and out of ports along our busiest@ highways and through our most crowded cities
588,anxieties which are currently felt@ most acutely by those@ living near destruction plants@ themselves may not always remain so localised
589,at pontypool the collision@ between@ a precise scientific industry and a diffuse@ unscientific local suspicion is painfully@ apparent
590,local people mutter and march make@ speeches and throw things staff face@ sarcasm in nearby pubs and for years there have been demands for a public inquiry
591,rechem has responded@ with@ a rather desperate@ open-door policy aimed@ at@ soothing@ fears and more recently by issuing about@ a dozen writs against@ the fiercest critics
592,we are an aggressive@ company admitted@ david wheeler operations@ director at this@ plant@ and at rechem's other incinerator at fawley
593,for a place so hated the pontypool plant@ looks innocuous inside like a cross@ between@ an oil refinery and a crematorium
594,mr wheeler an engineer who worked for many years in@ the oil business@ is a pleasant slightly worried-looking man who cannot bear@ the fact that no one seems to realise just what lengths@ he goes@ to@ in order to keep@ the plant@ squeaky clean and emission-free@ 
595,in hard hats and protective@ glasses we walked past the huge fume cupboard@ where the most noxious barrels are opened and arrived at the vast closed mouth@ of the furnace itself
596,it was hot but not burning
597,there was a fault on the computer governing the plant@ said mr wheeler and the fire had automatically shut@ down@ 
598,these@ pipes stretching@ thinly in@ a bridge@ across the service road injected@ a mix of chemicals into the walls of the furnace itself did i know that fuel was only used in@ the start-up process after@ which the chemicals themselves provided the fire
599,workers in blue overalls drifted@ around us and cracked@ jokes in@ gentle@ welsh accents 
600,in the furnace control office i found shift@ foreman keith thomas and asked innocently if he had@ any physical problems not since my vasectomy
601,a grin
602,he lived locally so how did neighbours view@ his job here
603,you get@ sarcasm mainly
604,a lot@ of my friends are pleased that the company is doing@ the job they are doing 
605,others are not so well informed
606,you couldn't hope to convert@ them
607,at a nearby house leonard hough a retired schoolmaster had earlier told me about@ the fog which he says comes@ from the factory
608,it blows@ along the valley
609,they've improved the chimney recently and it's very much better than it was but we still get@ the smells
610,and since they've refused repeatedly to have@ a public inquiry into@ what is going@ on@ there we're not certain of the safety of what's coming@ out
611,we get@ smoke from the steel works across the valley but we know what that@ is and we're not afraid of it
612,keith thomas pressed a button and a huge door clanked upwards so that i could peer into the heart@ of the furnace
613,piles of ruddy-brown ash lay@ heaped on the floor
614,pumps sucked@ air inwards
615,heat shone out
616,in@ here@ they burn about@ # tonnes of chemicals a year a quarter@ originating outside britain
617,the waste arrives at@ the rate@ of up to@ seven tanker-loads every day that@ is seven lorries passing thousands of doorsteps
618,right here@ in this@ gaping@ mouth@ lies@ the end@ of the chain@ 
619,the wastes include lindane ddt out-of-date drugs carcinogenic chemicals old cigars and even pornography a different kind of pollution@ 
620,about@ # tonnes of the total waste is pcb-contaminated
621,pcbs are so difficult to destroy that rechem's emission-monitoring systems are geared to@ detecting them on@ the grounds@ that if you destroy pcbs you destroy everything
622,this@ of course is a key point@ 
623,if you did not burn chemicals like pcbs what else would you do with@ them
624,the sea
625,the earth
626,we are not in@ the business@ of polluting the environment mr wheeler insisted
627,we are on@ the side@ of the angels@ 
628,environmental organisations however put@ the emphasis@ elsewhere@ 
629,there is no incinerator which completely destroys toxic wastes madeleine cobbing greenpeace's toxics campaigner told me
630,the crux of our argument is that we don't need to have@ toxic wastes and the fact that plants@ like rechem exist providing easy options for companies is acting@ as a disincentive for companies to clean@ up@ 
631,but another but what about@ the pcbs that already exist
632,although they are no longer manufactured they are still present for example in electrical equipment
633,no one could therefore call@ for the closure of incineration plants@ at@ a stroke@ because noxious chemicals have to go@ somewhere
634,so a part@ of the argument switches@ to@ the kind of incinerators you allow while industry is forced@ to clean@ itself up@ 
635,also how these@ should function and perhaps most important of all where you put them
636,mr wheeler now moving to the rear of the plant@ to show off the #m smoke-cleaning section@ which had just broken down pointed@ out@ that his company achieved@ destruction of at least # per cent of all materials
637,the company's figures imply that when you have burnt # per cent of a #-tonne annual throughput a figure of # of a tonne remains@ 
638,in@ # according to friends@ of the earth a survey@ of the homes clustered on the surrounding hills found@ that three-quarters of # residents were opposed to@ the rechem plant@ 
639,the plant@ should be relocated because it's in the wrong place llew smith the local euro-mp told me
640,it is in a valley and in a highly populated area
641,what did mr wheeler make@ of that@ 
642,if we do it properly any spot is the right spot he insisted
643,stack@ emissions of pcbs were below@ the american standard@ for breathing air # times lower@ than the british equivalent
644,regular soil and grass tests showed@ no difference between@ pcb contamination in the immediate area and elsewhere in wales though there are no established safe levels@ for these@ 
645,five air-monitoring plants@ had been installed he tookme to see them
646,and here were drumsof chemicals each labelled each with a job number to check against@ sampling
647,and yet there are accidents
648,in@ # aluminium melted in the furnace reacted@ with@ water and exploded sending@ a black cloud over nearby houses
649,later drumssupposedly containing carcinogenic drugs were not opened for checking before@ burning for health reasons and three were misdescribed 
650,they too reacted with@ water and a plant@ operator was burned by a cloud@ of acid gas
651,we walked past a tanker where a huge man named andy matthews was pumping vinyl acetate into a #-gallon vat wreathed@ in@ its sweet@ sickly@ smell i've been here two years he said
652,my father was an industrial chemist and he said if you want to go and work for them go and work for them
653,were there any spillages
654,he shrugged
655,nothing major
656,i might drop a pipe a little bit@ of a splash
657,in a large prefabricated shed we wandered past stacks of #-gallon drums of pcbs two drums high about@ # deep and there were contaminated transformers waiting@ to be cut@ up@ and roasted@ in the flames
658,back@ along@ the waste chain@ the liverpool dockers who objected to@ the import of exactly this@ type of chemical should be aware that pcbs are moving@ about our roads all the time
659,there was no difference between@ the liquid in these@ drums and the liquid in the cargoes they refused to touch
660,in liverpool a dockers' spokesman with@ the transport and general workers union admitted drivers aren't happy handling some of these@ commodities but at least a lorry-driver has@ more idea of what he is handling than a docker who could have@ a consignment and just not know what it is
661,yet he did not oppose all toxic waste movement after@ all the same union represents workers at rechem itself he simply didn't like the idea that big@ industrial nations like canada could dump@ their dirty@ problems on@ this@ country and his members@ 
662,driving away i noticed that the vast chimney was still not functioning but when i called@ at a neighbouring house a woman showed me videos she had taken@ of smoke coming@ from the plant@ settling@ in her garden
663,certainly the incinerator seems well controlled
664,certainly there is no scientific evidence that living nearby increases the risk of sickness
665,certainly mr wheeler convinced me that his company was going@ to@ huge@ lengths@ to keep@ itself clean
666,we must run@ it safely in@ the short@ term and long@ term he said because if people are able to demonstrate that we are causing an environment problem we will be shut@ down@ 
667,in@ april # a tanker spilled@ # litres of pcbs over the main trans-canada highway on the border between ontario and manitoba
668,a section@ of the road was shut@ for a week and motorists were warned to clean their cars and to dispose of the rags in plastic bags

679,by olivia timbs
680,fads for vitamin supplements have been overtaken@ by a vogue for minerals and trace@ elements
681,zinc is the latest lack of it supposedly causes a range@ of problems although little scientific evidence supports@ the link@ 
682,but some reports have suggested@ that low@ zinc levels@ may lead@ to@ problems in@ pregnancy from@ difficult labour to@ congenital malformations in@ children
683,there is stronger@ evidence that a zinc deficiency may cause the foetus to grow slowly in the womb
684,doctors in bristol decided to test the theory
685,in@ a study of nearly # women they found@ that zinc supplements did not improve either foetal health or reduce@ the number of pre-term labours
686,the doctors conclude in@ the british medical journal that there would be little benefit if all women in the uk were given zinc supplements during pregnancy
687,they recognise@ however that the women in@ their study were largely middle-class who might well have sufficiently large@ zinc stores@ because they were well nourished
688,further studies the researchers believe should concentrate@ on@ pregnant women known to have@ a zinc deficiency or to be at@ risk from@ problems during labour

726,in@ the us weekly audience ratings in@ # there were three westerns in@ the top@ five and seven in@ the top@ #
727,by@ the mid-# they had all gone@ the way@ of the buffalo extinct@ save for preservation@ in the national@ park@ of permanent re-runs
728,gene autry the first tv cowboy now # says westerns dominated@ the early days of tv partly because they had lively cheaply produced visuals but mainly because early tv was starved@ of feature films by the studios
729,westerns were a handy@ substitute@ 
730,there are encouraging signs@ however that the tv western is struggling@ back@ into@ the saddle@ 
731,paradise launched@ on@ cbs last season and shown@ on@ bbc# this@ summer was the first new western serial for a decade
732,it was the only new drama series in@ us network tv to be allowed@ a second series this@ year despite a relatively lowly@ #th ranking in@ the ratings
733,its creator and executive producer is perhaps surprisingly david jacobs
734,why did he follow@ j r ewing the epitome of # tv with@ a western about@ a gunfighter turned foster father
735,i believed the genre was still an important and powerful@ one
736,it's something i've always had@ an affection for
737,i found@ it was possible with@ paradise to talk@ about@ individual and personal responsibility something which if set@ in@ a contemporary context@ would have had@ a preachy feel@ about@ it
738,lonesome dove a five-part story of a texas-to-montana cattle drive also shown on@ cbs last year was the best-watched tv mini-series of any kind in america for five years
739,it won@ substantial@ critical acclaim and will show in britain next@ year
740,the #-# season which started this@ month brought@ another new prime-time western series abc's young riders which tells@ the story of the pony express
741,it also says@ a lot about@ modern american tv
742,because the networks believe@ westerns appeal@ mainly to@ middle-aged men young riders has@ a cast@ of five pouting young male actors in@ an attempt to make@ a western with@ good demographics
743,the effect is rather an extended@ advertisement@ for marlboro@ lights@ 
744,westerns are no longer a cheap option
745,the classic western tv series were filmed in back-lots or in the semi-desert # miles from los angeles
746,modern audiences no longer accept plastic bushes and the southern californian suburban sprawl@ means the production companies have to take@ their horses and cows to locations far away in arizona or montana
747,david jacobs also points@ out@ that the cost of hiring a stage-coach is now prohibitive
748,at@ one time there were dozens of companies which specialised in@ renting out western paraphernalia
749,now there are maybe two
750,the cost has gone@ through@ the barn@ roof@ 
751,and actors can no longer ride
752,they have to be sent to cowboy school
753,westerns by their nature@ demand@ more time on location
754,as a result mr jacobs says it cost nearly as much to make@ an episode of paradise with relatively unknown actors as an episode of dallas with its big@ stars@ 
755,will the western ride@ again
756,john mantley is cautious
757,westerns have@ a gladiatorial@ timeless quality
758,on@ the other hand@ you have@ a whole@ generation@ of tv watchers that doesn't really know the rules@ 
759,a western is like a japanese noh play
760,it is a stylised drama with@ understated dialogue that depends on@ recognition of key words and concepts
761,many of the young people today have@ n't the first idea of what's going@ on@ 
762,in@ the inert@ # the western represented a troubled@ adventurous@ american past
763,in@ the anxious@ and eventful late # and # they may come@ to represent like all creatures great and small in britain a less confusing past with@ simpler deeper@ values@ 
764,maybe
765,on@ the other hand@ the young riders came@ #t in@ the ratings in@ its first week trailing@ far@ far@ behind@ all the modern myths about@ modern times such as the cosby show roseanne golden girls cheers and matlock
766,it is premature@ then to say that the western has galloped@ back@ to@ centre@ screen
767,but there is a puff@ of dust@ on@ the horizon@ 
768,law always take along a friend to sue litigation can pay off even in@ the unlikeliest circumstances
769,stephen gold explains
770,by stephen gold
771,when things@ go wrong you can sue more often than you may think
772,money may not have changed@ hands@ 
773,someone may have even done you a favour
774,it doesn't matter
775,as long as you can show@ that they owed you a legal duty to be careful and have been negligent damagescould come@ your way@ 
776,there are a numberof points@ to bear@ in@ mind
777,take up references before@ giving@ credit lending money letting in tenants taking on staff
778,ask@ banks building societies former landlords present@ and past employers
779,if you rely to@ your detriment on@ a misleading reference which was given@ negligently you should be able to sue the referee
780,the subject@ of a bad reference can sue the referee for libel but has to show@ the referee was up@ to@ no good spite ill@ or some improper motive will do@ 
781,take along@ a prosperous adviser@ on@ all shopping sprees demonstrate a high@ degree@ of trust and strong@ reliance in@ what they say and you may have@ unexpected protection should the seller go out of@ business and the goods fall@ to@ pieces@ 
782,a #-year-old woman accountant who knew nothing about@ the mechanical side@ of vehicles asked her more knowledgeable friend to find a car for her
783,she stipulated that it must never have been involved in@ an accident
784,the friend found one ata garage
785,although he failed to check it had been accident-free he assured the lady that this@ was the case
786,she bought@ it
787,it had been in@ an accident and it was worthless
788,in@ may last year the court of appeal upheld a judgment against@ the friend for more than # damages for negligence because he had owed the accountant a duty of care
789,your conservatory collapses as a result of negligence of the professionals who were engaged by the previous owner to put it up
790,you can sue the professionals builders architects surveyors or engineers by courtesy@ of the defective premises act # despite the fact that you never had@ a contract with@ them yourself
791,there are strict@ time limits generally six years from@ when damage first occurred@ where@ the damage was initially latent you are given@ longer three years from@ when you could have discoveredit with@ a long@ stop@ of # years
792,it may also be possible to claim damages against@ a local authority for negligently failing@ to ensure that construction work complied@ with@ the relevant building regulations
793,a solicitor fails to draw up a will within@ a reasonable@ time for a client who subsequently dies
794,you lose@ the gift which the will would have made@ 
795,you can sue the solicitor for what you would have collected@ had he done his job properly because the law reckons@ he owed you as well as his client a duty of care
796,when you want to borrow on@ a mortgage the prospective lenders will have@ the property valued at@ your expense
797,there is no contract between@ you and the valuer
798,but if the valuer is negligent and you buy the property relying on@ his report you may still be able to sue him for damages
799,this@ is what the house of lords decided@ in@ two cases last april in spite of an attempt to get@ the valuers off@ the hook@ by a disclaimer which said@ i accept that the valuer does not warrant anything stated in@ his report as being accurate@ 
800,alas disclaimers may work@ if for example the property being valued is industrial or an expensive house
801,disclaimers may also be usedby referees and others to rob@ you of a claim for damages
802,whoever attempts to hide@ behind@ a disclaimer must prove it is fair@ and reasonable to do so
803,but a disclaimer can never take@ away@ your rights under@ the defective premises act # for the collapsing conservatory or prevent anyone being sued for negligence which has caused death or injury
804,have we yet reached@ the point@ at@ which we would be awarded damages against@ the meteorological office because we went camping on@ the day of an unforecast hurricane
805,or after we followed the duffadvice of a legal journalist in@ a newspaper
806,mercifully we doubt it
807,book review the cause without@ a rebel the pale companion andrew motion viking # pounds
808,by martin pacey
809,it was unfair of auden to suggest@ in@ his letter to lord byron that a poet's sense@ of other people's very hazy@ 
810,but the vaporous@ presences@ that float@ through@ this@ slender@ and anaemic@ first novel by a notable poet would appear to support@ the claim
811,the book which opens@ a projected@ sequence of novels that will cover@ the period from@ # to@ the present@ day aims@ to explore@ what the blurb describes@ as the painful@ transition from@ youth to@ adulthood
812,this@ of course is a popular subject@ it seems particularly attractive@ to@ the poet-turned-novelist because of the scope it offers for the tremulously@ sensitive@ probing@ of feelings
813,sensitivity@ though is not enough
814,what andrew motion presents@ us with@ here@ is a static and humourless@ mood-piece@ filled@ with@ over@ imagery@ 
815,the hero francis mayne is suffering from@ the adolescent's emotional confusion and acuteself-consciousness
816,he finds@ it hard@ to communicate with@ people not least his separated parents
817,his father is a faceless figure a retired brigadier reserved@ and taciturn
818,his mother by contrast@ is the most vividly@ realised character in@ the book nervy flirtatious and selfish already on@ her third husband she thinks primarily of her appearance even when visiting her dying daughter francis's twin
819,the first half of the novel is dominated@ by the girl's death from@ leukaemia
820,there is a refreshing@ simplicity and tenderness@ in@ motion's account@ of the way@ francis nurses her but she herself is too sketchily drawn@ for the episode to carry@ much weight@ 
821,meanwhile at@ his public school francis is conducting@ a love-affair with an older pupil named keith ogilvie
822,he is finally rejected by the devious@ arrogant keith who informs him that he is obsolete@ because he does not know how to make@ things@ happen
823,his response@ to@ this@ rejection is as flat@ as his reaction@ to@ the massive@ demonstration which keith has earlier persuaded him to join@ against@ the vietnam war
824,this@ violent@ event described at length in@ hysterically@ colourful@ terms is the only piece@ of history to be woven@ convincingly into@ the plot@ 
825,other broad@ hints as to the date are inserted@ with@ a comical lack of subtlety my god darling have you heard exclaims francis's mother one day as she greets him czechoslovakia
826,it's been invaded
827,motion will have to do better than this@ if he seriously intends his series of novels to capture@ the feel@ of a period
828,but the book's principal defect remains the vacuity of its protagonist
829,in@ his eagerness to depict the cloudy@ psychology of an adolescent motion has forgotten to give@ the boy a personality
830,he has however given@ him a psychotic compulsion to formulate fanciful similes
831,hardly a page goes@ by@ without@ the hapless francis noticing something which reminds him improbably of something else
832,sometimes he is reminded of several things@ 
833,one moment an avenue of chestnut trees looks a child@'s drawing@ of ghosts@ the next@ it appears frightening but derelict extinguished@ chandeliers@ and finally the chestnuts prance@ at@ him holding@ up@ their gleaming branches hysterics@ 
834,such writing rapidly palls and i hope that in@ the novels to come@ motion can curb his reckless passion for it
835,motoring a lead-free lover@'s guide@ to@ used cars drivers with@ a tight@ budget and an environmental conscience can buy second-hand without@ losing@ principles says james ruppert
836,by james ruppert
837,from@ this@ month all new cars submitted for british type approval the test which allows@ them@ to be legally sold in the uk must be able@ to run@ on@ lead-free petrol
838,as a result of this@ rule@ and many carefully orchestrated@ publicity campaigns@ the motor industry's image@ has now changed from@ polluter to@ pal@ of the earth
839,if you can afford an environmentally friendly g-registered runabout then the flora fauna and children of the british isles will have@ a lot to thank you for
840,but if you have@ a tight@ budget and a conscience running older cars on@ lead-free fuel becomes a much more complicated@ issue
841,without@ the presence of a lead compound an engine's valve seats@ go unprotected@ 
842,this@ leads@ to@ premature wear and plumes@ of blue smoke spewing@ from the exhaust
843,the only effective remedy@ is to install hardened valve seats@ or a replacement cylinder head@ both expensive options
844,less costly but not entirely satisfactory is the practice of making@ every fourth tankful leaded petrol which protects the valveseats@ but rather defeats@ the object@ 
845,alternatively there are several chemical additives on@ the market@ which aim@ to provide a substitute for lead although the case for these@ products has yet to be proved
846,however many cars built within@ the last few years have@ hardened valveseats@ or alloy cylinder heads@ that need@ little simply a retune@ or no modification to use unleaded petrol
847,finding out which cars can and which cannot is not difficult
848,esso filling stations have@ a free@ booklet listing@ most models produced since # as does@ the charity clear #-# # with@ more detail available in@ the unleaded petrol guideautodale #
849,looking at those@ lists provides interesting reading and bears out the used-car trade's view@ that having a lead-only car could prove to be a liability
850,it is not as if four-star leaded fuel is going to be phased out tomorrow but more and more buyers are asking does it take@ unleaded
851,what is certain is that the pre-# austin mg range@ all skodas yugos and quite a few lancias do not which does not help@ already depressed@ resale prices
852,a # lancia y# lead only sells for around@ # whereas the similar fiat uno # from@ the same year converted@ to run@ on@ unleaded is worth around@ # more
853,a lead-only second-hand car is now worth about@ # per cent less than an unleaded equivalent
854,in@ years to come@ the percentage difference is likely to be much larger@ 
855,even so exotica such as lead-only porsche # and ferraris are unlikely to be part@ of this@ trend so no bargains there@ i'm afraid
856,more impressive are the japanese manufacturers whose cars dating from@ the early eighties can run@ on@ unleaded without@ adjustment
857,find a # toyota corolla or # nissan sunny that has not succumbed@ to@ rust and you can buy with@ confidence
858,on@ the home front@ most fords and vauxhalls from@ at least the mid-eighties can useunleaded
859,if the greenness@ of going unleaded still seems a bit@ of a grey@ area@ it is possible to switch to@ diesel without@ a shadow@ of environmental doubt
860,diesel always has been lead-free and the only adjustments@ you need to make@ are mental ones@ because diesel-powered cars are no longer slow smelly or noisy
861,they also return@ more miles to@ the gallon than their petrol equivalents although service intervals@ are shorter@ 
862,but after@ the publicity on@ unleaded fuel there has been increased interest in@ used diesel power
863,but remember that these@ cars accrue and can withstand significantly higher@ mileages than petrol cars #-# being the norm
864,the tradition for diesel cars is far@ better established on the continent and that@ is where the best buys come@ from
865,perhaps the most successful@ maker is peugeot with@ a complete range@ of cars from@ the small # around@ # for a #-mile # car to@ the legendary # =estate about@ # for a # example
866,the germans are also fairly accomplished manufacturers although a five-door # golf with@ a six-figure mileage will still cost #
867,prestige comes@ in@ the shape@ of a mercedes with@ the #d or stuttgart taxi commanding@ # but returning@ unfailing reliability
868,even if lead levels@ in the atmosphere do not bother you i am sure you will find@ the fact that unleaded petrol is #p cheaper and that diesel fuel boosts@ mpg by@ at least a third most interesting

885,in@ the first of a monthly series michael jackson hunts@ in vain
886,by michael jackson
887,thank god it's saturday
888,i know that today is saturday because already i am thirsty for a dry@ hoppy pint of bitter at@ the end@ of the afternoon an aperitif to sharpen@ my appetite for this@ evening's indian meal
889,how did you feel@ as you came@ to@ the end@ of your working week yesterday afternoon
890,boy i had@ a thirst
891,we say we are thirsty when we mean that we fancy a glass of wine a pint of beer a gin and tonic or a shot@ of whisky the pleasure of naming our poison@ at@ the end@ of a busy@ day or tiresome week
892,that@ is not thirst
893,to enjoy it we do not need to be dry@ just in need of a restorative or relaxant or maybe a focus@ for a social moment or brief@ encounter
894,we call it thirst in lieu of a more accurate@ description
895,no not more accurate@ thirst is not accurate@ at all as a description for this@ apparently indescribable condition
896,it is a desire millions of us know and share@ yet for which we have@ no name
897,this@ desire that cannot find@ its name though it would dare@ speak@ it if it could is pleasurable
898,it is enjoyable feeling@ gently@ hungry or amorous@ 
899,no not amorous randy@ we have@ a word for that@ 
900,any of these@ conditions is pleasurable so long as there is a good likelihood of satisfaction in@ reasonably short@ order@ 
901,let puritans@ and pessimists damn disapprove or dismiss@ these@ appetites@ that@ is their loss@ 
902,those@ of us who enjoy them need only a name for each condition so that we may discuss them in@ expectation and in@ recollection
903,come@ to think of it neither hunger nor randiness hits@ quite the spot@ 
904,peckishness and lust perhaps
905,or does that@ sound a firm@ of country@ solicitors@ 
906,this@ is to digress
907,what of this@ thirst that can be satisfied@ by an unquenching@ drink
908,wine is not quenching@ but no less in@ demand for that@ 
909,try to quench@ your thirst with a light@ fresh white and you will drink enough to put@ you on@ your back@ 
910,beer is quite rightly britain's favourite friday night drink
911,it can momentarily blunt@ a thirst but not altogether cut@ it
912,the nearest to@ being quenching@ is the white beer of berlin
913,anything with even a modest@ smack@ of hops dries@ the palate ready@ for the next@ one
914,so of course does alcohol itself
915,it may for a moment seem to quench@ but it dehydrates as purportedly healthy abstainers are forever telling me
916,to quench@ is more than to refresh although our lying@ lascivious@ eyes tell@ us the two are the same
917,does any drink look more quenching@ than one of those@ italian or french patent aperitifs swirling@ in@ a refractive pink or russet oiliness@ clothing@ the melting ice a campari dubonnet lillet or too rare in this country a picon
918,are they quenching@ 
919,no refreshing
920,in strasburg they have been known to lace@ beer with@ picon thereby ruining both drinks as queen victoria reputedly did with claret and malt whisky but still the result is not especially quenching@ 
921,perhaps a shimmering dry@ martini cocktail minimum dilution stirred not shaken and served straight@ up@ looks even more refreshing though its effect is that@ of a silver@ mallet@ 
922,in the right place possibly new york but san francisco is better the martini is the ultimate thank god it's friday drink
923,the requirement for such pleasures is a matter of time and place and it does not have to be friday berlin or strasburg new york or san francisco
924,not feeling thirsty but fancying a drink has@ a world@ of moments
925,some frenchmen start the day with a coffee and calvados
926,the people of munich call their version of weissbier breakfast beer and have it with a pair of coddled veal sausages
927,new orleans favours@ a mid-morning milk punch@ or its own variation on@ the gin fizz
928,if the moment is before@ a lunch on the plane it really ought to be a bloody mary
929,if it is at an elegant dinner table there is a choice between@ a fino sherry or a manzanilla or champagne
930,none of these@ requires anything even approaching@ a thirst
931,do we really wash@ down@ a good meal with claret
932,port is immediately suggested@ by stilton cognac by coffee
933,i do not fully appreciate the experience of an american late-night movie without a bourbon or a book at@ bedtime without a single malt
934,these@ are not moments of thirst but nor are they causes of drunkenness unless one tries to pack@ all such experiences into@ one day
935,we do not drink because we are thirsty
936,nor if we are in@ civilised cast@ of mind because we wish to become drunk
937,a friend of mine says that her body tells@ her without@ being asked@ the season of the year
938,at@ the end@ of summer her body stops wanting@ gin and tonics and suddenly desires@ whisky
939,if it were only a matter of alcohol would a body care@ 
940,people will nevertheless say that the desire is for nothing more than alcohol
941,so why not a pill or an injection
942,because there would be no colour no ritual@ no time and place no glorious variety
943,worst of all there would be no aroma taste texture or finish
944,these@ are sensuous pleasures at@ their most enjoyable when we ritualise@ them but how do we feel@ when we desire them
945,we who have@ so many words in@ our language have@ none for this@ 
946,but then do the french spanish or italians have@ a word for it
947,perhaps they do maybe i have not being paying@ attention too busy with@ the eau-de-vie anis or grappa
948,do the greeks have@ a word for it
949,could we borrow@ beg or invent one
950,answers in a bottle please
951,if you are feeling@ for lack of a better word -thirsty let's meet@ again next@ month

972,in the garden planning@ to beat@ a leafy retreat@ at home in@ the first of a series for novice@ gardeners anna pavord stresses@ the value@ of careful forethought
973,by anna pavord
974,plants should come@ a long@ way@ down@ the list@ of priorities for the novice@ gardener
975,there are many things@ to think about@ before@ even the first tentative daffodil bulb is sunk@ into the ground
976,the first and most important question to mull over as you gaze at your patch is what is this@ garden for
977,if you start writing down some of the responses to@ that@ question you will find@ you have along@ the way@ acquired a ragbag@ of elements@ that will have@ an important bearing@ on@ the design
978,if there are small children in@ the equation@ there will need to be a flat soft area where they can fall off swings and climbing frames
979,if you like hanging out washing rather than drying it in the bowels@ of an expensive machine you will need to tuck away a line and make a dry path to get to and from it
980,some novice@ gardeners may not want to do much actual gardening at all but conversely do not want to lookout every day over a scene of threadbare@ grass and rotting fence
981,their ideal garden will look good and demand@ little attention
982,if you are a dedicated sun-worshipper you need to mark@ out@ the part of the garden where the sun lingers@ longest
983,it may not be the part nearest the house though this@ is where sitting out areas always tend to be made
984,you may even as a novice@ care so passionately about@ plants that all you want is the maximum space to grow them in
985,raised beds@ built down@ an unpromising alley could provide extra gardening space
986,privacy is an important consideration
987,a first time garden is usually small and certainly the typical one i am imagining for this@ series is no more than #ft x #ft and surrounded on all sides by other houses
988,privacy is a ticklish@ business where@ close@ neighbours are concerned
989,to throw up an impenetrable berlin@ wall@ between you and them could be tactless
990,trellis is a useful compromise and you can always pretend it was forced@ on@ you by the speed of growth of your climbing@ rose
991,aesthetes among@ the novices@ will by now be thoroughly irritable and complaining that gardens should have as much to do with@ the soul as with@ the necessity or not of a washing line or a barbecue pit
992,so they should and when the list of necessities is securely written down you can ask the second question how do i want this@ garden to feel@ 
993,this@ question produces@ as varied a response as the first
994,some urban gardeners as short@ of space inside as they are out want their gardens to be extensions of their homes with@ a great@ deal@ of hard paving good furniture and lighting

996,closet countrysiders may want to pretend their patch is actually a corner of some sussex meadow and picture@ it swagged@ with honeysuckle and waving@ with ox-eye@ daisies and scabious
997,this@ is a difficult trick to bring off with@ suburban trains hurtling by on one side and lorries grinding@ through@ their gears on the other
998,a leafy retreat@ is an excellent goal@ for a small town garden but it is best made acknowledging the urban setting using un-wild plants such as bamboo acanthus fig vine alchemilla euphorbia wisteria
999,while you are working through@ this@ process take@ note@ of the features in the garden that you would like to keep
1000,on a new estate there may be nothing
1001,in an old@ garden there may be a fruit tree or a good bulwark of evergreen laurel or box that tidied up could add@ a dash of venerability@ to@ the new garden that will emerge@ around it

1009,andrew bibby reports
1010,by andrew bibby
1011,in the small devon town of south molton julie widlake is waiting with@ anticipation for friday # october
1012,she and her boyfriend have had@ their future planned@ for some time they want to start farming in a nearby village where they also intend to build a bungalow
1013,first they have to sell their present house a two-bedroom cottage in the centre of the town
1014,as is the case almost everywhere else the market@ in devon is depressed@ and selling has not been easy
1015,so instead of waiting indefinitely for a buyer they have decided to try selling their house by auction
1016,it comes@ under@ the hammer@ at@ #pm on@ the #th at the barnstaple motel
1017,we accept that we might not get very much for it but on@ the other hand@ we could get more says julie widlake
1018,we've been waiting to move for a long@ time and we need the money to build the new house
1019,their south molton cottage guide@ price #-# is one of more than # lots to be put@ up@ for sale at@ the barnstaple auction by bristol and west property services and one of more than a hundred which the building society subsidiary will be auctioning in eight west country venues over@ a three-day period
1020,bristol and west claims@ these@ auctions will help@ to bring@ some action@ to@ an otherwise slow@ market@ and says@ it was overwhelmed@ by the response@ from@ people wanting to sell in@ this@ way@ 
1021,auctions certainly speed up the house-buying process 
1022,once the hammer@ has fallen@ the successful bidder for a house must exchange contracts immediately and pay a deposit
1023,completion normally takes@ place@ four to@ eight weeks later and there is no opportunity for second thoughts
1024,as the bristol and west explains@ if a bidder does not sign the contract the auctioneer can sign on@ their behalf
1025,from@ the vendor's point@ of view@ the house is actually sold once a successful bid is made@ says graham harrison director of bristol and west property services
1026,many people have suffered from@ sales falling through and from@ house-buying chains@ and some of our vendors feel@ that now's as good a time as any to sell
1027,from@ the purchasers' point@ of view@ auctions can also be attractive@ if slightly nerve-racking as you wait for bidding to start for the house of your dreams@ 
1028,the problem is that normally potential purchasers have to incur the expense of undertaking surveys@ and arranging@ mortgage finance without@ any idea whether they will be able to afford the final selling price
1029,not surprisingly several estate agents report difficulties at@ the moment in@ attracting@ enough serious bidders
1030,with@ an auction you've got to be certain that at least two buyers are there who can commit@ themselves and the difficulty is that buyers who can proceed@ are few and far@ between@ said david phillip a director of yorkshire estate agents dacre son and hartley
1031,bristol and west hopes@ that by arranging@ collective auctions it will be able@ to overcome this@ problem
1032,it is also guaranteeing mortgages at@ # per cent below@ the normal interest rate for endowment or pension-linked@ policies on@ several of the houses up@ for sale an interesting and innovative service for would-be bidders mortgage surveys@ will already have been undertaken for these@ houses
1033,the building society will be staffing@ a mortgage desk at@ each auction and says@ buyers could arrange@ finance there@ and then@ subject of course to@ proof of income and status
1034,obviously however bristol and west hopes@ to hear from@ interested people in@ advance@ if only so it can gauge@ the likely demand for each property before the auction starts
1035,we're trying to smooth@ the path@ for purchasers and streamline@ the system@ says graham harrison pointing@ out@ that live@ telephone bidding will also be available for those@ unable to attend
1036,holiday homes and commercial property have been included@ among@ the lots to be auctioned
1037,although collective property auctions take@ place@ regularly in london often primarily for investors rather than house-hunters@ in country areas the more typical auction will be just for one house and as likely as not will take@ place@ in a nearby pub or village hall
1038,in@ fact country auctions are often the nearest@ many villages get@ to@ live@ theatre@ 
1039,the locals come for the entertainment and to see who's buying into@ their village observed one auction-goer
1040,pub landlords are usually only too happy to provide free@ accommodation
1041,it's very exciting and gets@ the adrenalin going@ says david phillip whose firm usually undertakes@ auctions in the otley area
1042,only certain types of property normally come@ to@ auction however
1043,traditionally country cottages and houses which have@ unusual or unique features@ or are in need of a lot@ of renovation may be auctioned if only because valuation is likely to be difficult
1044,sometimes too houses have to be sold by auction to satisfy the legal requirements of trustees or executors auctions provide adequate proof that the property has been sold at@ the going market@ value and protect@ trustees from@ future claims of negligence
1045,less happily but for the same reason repossessed houses are often auctioned
1046,anyone considering@ selling by auction needs to be aware that the costs involved will be higher@ 
1047,advertising costs and any expenses incurred in@ hiring premises are normally passed@ on@ by the estate agents to@ the vendor whether or not the auction results in@ a sale
1048,in addition agents may charge@ slightly more commission than usual for a successful@ sale
1049,in bristol and west's forthcoming auctions a set fee of # plus vat will be charged@ to@ everyone entering@ property to sell with@ its usual agent's commission@ about@ # per cent plus vat charged@ on@ top@ when sales are made@ 
1050,we accept that we could lose@ the money we've paid to go@ to@ auction but that@'s a risk we're prepared@ to take@ says julie widlake
1051,the secret of a successful outcome depends partly on@ setting@ the right reserve price a task the auctioneer undertakes in conjunction with the seller
1052,normally the reserve is set@ only days or hours before@ the auction when the agents will already have@ a good indication of how much interest has been shown@ 
1053,too high@ a reserve price can mean no sale and disappointment all round@ 
1054,you need to understand what your clients expectations are beforehand says graham harrison of bristol and west
1055,agents and their clients may also have@ the dilemma of deciding whether to accept any offers made@ prior to the auction
1056,inevitably they do not always get@ it right
1057,peter crowther managing director of a leeds business centre@ recently bought two semi-detached stone cottages in bramhope on the outskirts of leeds at@ an auction in the village pub
1058,his successful bid was for # although he had made@ a higher@ prior offer which had been turned@ down@ 
1059,on@ the other hand@ sometimes the drama@ of the auction and the competition between@ bidders can have@ the opposite@ effect
1060,another recent auction in leeds saw@ a run-down stone farmhouse without water or other amenities finally fall@ under@ the hammer@ for #
1061,success is by no means guaranteed at@ auction says graham harrison
1062,in@ a tough@ market@ you need to get@ the programme right the price right and have@ a little bit@ of luck
1063,bristol and west property services # # has produced a brochure covering@ all eight west country auctions
1064,design crossed@ lines@ over@ the toytown tram city transport could soon be back@ on@ the right track@ says jonathan glancey
1065,by jonathan glancey
1066,modern trams as most continental europeans know neither shake nor rattle nor do they roll
1067,sleek@ solidly built gentle@ on@ the environment they are often an ideal form@ of city transport
1068,they also exert@ a fascination very much of their own as they slither@ round circuses and brush@ through old city gates flashing arcs of lightning as they switch tracks on@ winter nights
1069,single-car articulated or double-decker trams are one of the most reliable and enduring forms@ of public transport invented
1070,the orange-liveried@ # series trams in milan for example date from@ #
1071,eventually they will be replaced but more than # years on@ they run@ with@ the rhythmic@ reliability of a swiss watch
1072,they are as much a part of milan as la scala or the galleria vittore emmanuele
1073,last month it was announced that britain will get@ its first new-wave@ trams in@ #
1074,destined@ to run@ in manchester they will relieve@ traffic congestion@ and help@ to reduce@ the levels@ of carbon monoxide in the city centre outlying suburbs and satellite@ towns of bury altrincham salford oldham and rochdale
1075,in britain with@ the main exception of blackpool not forgetting the single-deckers of the isle of man and llandudno trams had been largely relegated to@ the history books
1076,otherwise the best place to see working@ trams has been the tram museum at crich in derbyshire or else in@ old british transport commission films and ealing comedies
1077,trams disappeared from most british cities in@ the #
1078,london's venerable@ red and cream double-deckers rumbled along the thames embankment for the last time in@ #
1079,somehow the image@ of the tall thin mournful@ double-deck tram with its wooden body@ slatted wooden seats and growling@ electric motor has stuck@ in@ the british mind@ 
1080,trams it was believed until@ surprisingly recently are old-fashioned
1081,they had@ something to do@ with@ fish and chips wrapped in newspaper men in hats national health specs smog and powdered egg
1082,they held@ up@ the bright@ new diesel buses and even worse blocked@ the progressof private motorists in bulbous@ austins and lumpen@ humbers in canyon@ city thoroughfares
1083,they picked@ up@ power from a spider@'s@ web@ of unsightly overhead wires
1084,they were inflexible@ in@ operation@ draughty and mobile reminders of tb epidemics with the enamelled do not spit signs screwed to their bulkheads
1085,but the modern tram could hardly be more different
1086,it plays@ a key role@ in@ keeping@ city streets on@ the move and is even the object of the best modern designers' desire
1087,in milan for example the commission to design the new generation@ of jumbo trams which went@ into@ service in@ # was one that leading@ italian architects and designers fought@ over@ 
1088,after@ all the jumbo a handsome@ and imposing articulated unit designed by architect engineer and critic klaus giovanni koenig will be seen on the streets of milan for the next@ half@ 
1089,spotlessly clean and popular the jumbo is a long-term advertisement for koenig's design skills
1090,the modern tram is a green machine
1091,assuming@ the power station at the end of the line burns@ cleanly the tram is virtually pollution free@ 
1092,standing@ at traffic lights a koenig-designed jumbo is save for the chatter inside completely silent
1093,the overhead wires are so slight@ that you have to look hard@ to see them
1094,powers of acceleration and braking are remarkable the latter far@ greater@ than any car
1095,but sadly there is no indication that the gma consortium which will design@ operate@ and maintain@ the first of the new generation@ british trams in manchester will share@ the looks of their milanese counterparts
1096,artists' impressions@ show@ a tram that has@ more in common with the flat-faced@ characterless light@ trains of the toy@ docklands light railway
1097,there is still time for gma gec mowlem amec and greater manchester buses to consider@ employing an inspired architect or industrial designer
1098,after@ all mancunians and visitors to the manchester conurbation are going to have to look at these@ mechanical millipedes@ for well into@ the twenty-first century
1099,now that buses are no longer designed to enhance the streets they serve@ manchester has@ a chance to make@ a fresh@ start@ with@ its trams
1100,manchester is not alone@ 
1101,other british towns croydon and southampton among@ them are also considering@ modern tramways
1102,these@ are all referred to@ as supertram networks the implication being that the new-generation@ tram is an altogether more dynamic@ form@ of transport than its pre-war predecessors@ 
1103,what it really means@ is that the new trams are a hybrid@ between@ street car and lightweight suburban train
1104,although they will slip@ through the city centre serving@ the essential parts shopping malls leisure centres theme parks amusement arcades and museums the manchester supertrams will also head@ out of town on a mix@ of reserved track and existing railway lines
1105,the supertram is in@ effect a low@ replacement for british rail's ageing@ fleet@ of suburban diesel multiple-unit trains those@ rasping@ diesels which change@ gear to@ the accompaniment@ of voluminous@ clouds@ of acrid black exhaust fumes and the blessing@ of train spotters
1106,they will perform@ some of the same functions but they will not be an exact replacement for traditional trams
1107,and although the supertram concept will spread@ through major cities during the next@ decade blackpool will still be alone in@ its use@ of traditional double-deckers
1108,the churches built on@ wool angela lambert enjoys the riches at@ the heart@ of east anglia
1109,by angela lambert
1110,until@ six or seven years ago outsiders associated@ east anglia with@ fens flatness and the vanished edwardian nannies of frinton
1111,its old churches green fields and long beaches were cherished by the inhabitants of essex suffolk norfolk and cambridgeshire but not yet on@ the tourist agenda
1112,today i was told villagers living around the great wool churches of lavenham and long melford have to bar their doors and ignore the knocking of tourists who take@ them for antique shops and offer to buy their furniture
1113,the tourists are right
1114,east anglia on@ a sunny weekend is a place of matchless beauty
1115,its villages look too good to be true
1116,lavenham and long melford for example have@ no telegraph poles to preserve@ the timeless air@ that pervades@ them
1117,yet you only have to read ronald blythe's akenfield to realise that these@ picturesque half-timbered cottages often painted the characteristic essex pink pale salmon ochre or spring-leaf green are more prosperous now than ever in@ the real past
1118,many are still elaborately decorated with pargeting an ornate patterned plasterwork practised in this@ area since the early thirteenth century
1119,most of east anglia's prosperity today is due to city commuters the second-homes market@ and tourism
1120,the ideal hotel from which to explore is dedham hall set among tall trees in the vale of dedham looking@ directly across towards dedham church on one side and flatford mill on the other both painted by constable
1121,the hotel lies@ in five acres of fields and garden and the slingos who own it make@ the most of their beautiful surroundings by running@ painting courses@ for about@ # a week including@ breakfast and dinner or # for a long@ weekend
1122,these@ are so popular that you will need to book at least a couple@ of months in@ advance@ 
1123,the other great@ joy of dedham hall is the food
1124,the slingos have their own vegetable garden chickens ducks sheep and cows
1125,everything is home-grown home-made and fresh it tastes like forgotten food
1126,if dedham hall is fully booked and it may well be try the best bed-and-breakfast we have ever found just a few miles away at the old vicarage higham near colchester
1127,it is a rambling tudor house run@ by john and margaret parker whose breakfast room and drawing room look@ out over a wonderful walled garden beyond which fields of grazing cows stretch@ down@ to the river
1128,another hotel that would make@ a good starting@ point@ for a weekend or longer in east anglia is the black lion at long melford
1129,it changed@ hands@ recently and is now run@ by stephen and janet errington
1130,after@ dinner there when the moon was full@ and low and deep@ orange we walked up@ the road from the hotel to long melford church
1131,its vast walls of flint and glass and gothic tracery were brilliantly floodlit and the churchyard cat sleek and black as tar greeted@ us querulously@ and led@ us right round the church and through the gravestones at the back@ glimmering and pale@ in the moonlight
1132,we were quite alone and the great church the size of a cathedral was unearthly in@ its floodlit moonlit beauty
1133,long melford is one of the wool churches that commemorate@ the wealth of east anglia in@ the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries
1134,another is at lavenham # minutes' drive up@ the road
1135,just inside the front porch a handwritten book is prefaced with@ the words this book has been compiled that something more than their mere names may be known of the lavenham men who gave@ their lives for their country in@ the great@ war
1136,this@ is followed@ by # or so names each with a description
1137,the much-thumbed book is deeply@ moving@ and sets@ the tone@ for a walk round this@ glorious building which has seen@ the christenings marriages and burials of the folk of the village for more than # years
1138,east anglia is exceptionally rich@ in@ churches and cathedrals
1139,there are several splendid houses near long melford that would make@ for a gentle@ afternoon's potter through the rooms and possessions of the rich of a few centuries ago
1140,the loveliest to@ my mind is melford hall whose charming octagonal jacobean gatehouse is reached along an avenue of clipped yew trees and with its high windows flooding@ the octagon with@ light is my fantasy of the ideal study
1141,lavenham is often called the finest@ medieval village in england
1142,it is an image@ of the world we have lost@ its gently@ sloping streets converging upon the market place
1143,here@ stand@ the early sixteenth-century timbered guildhall now a museum to@ # years of the cloth industry
1144,next to it is the little hall dating from@ the fourteenth century with its floorboards gleaming with@ the patina of age low-beamed ceilings and a tiny unruly@ charming walled garden
1145,precisely next door to this@ is a restaurant called the great house
1146,here@ in the cool@ pretty setting of the dining room that was once stephen spender's you will be served an exquisite three-course@ lunch for # # for children
1147,the wine list is small@ but perfectly chosen
1148,the service is impeccable
1149,east anglia has@ bookshops filled with@ titles like # things for a boy to do
1150,constable landscapes
1151,gainsborough's house to say nothing of huge grey sweeps@ of empty beach from which at aldeburgh you can buy goggle-eyed@ skate direct from the fishing boats as they come@ out of the water
1152,it has@ colchester oysters
1153,it has@ ely cathedral its great green windows casting@ a translucent light across the lady chapel
1154,with@ all this@ small@ wonder it also has@ tourists
1155,a prayer@ for the brick cathedral@ facing st paul's bankside power station is a masterpiece worth@ preserving gavin stamp argues
1156,by gavin stamp
1157,from the top of the dome of st paul's cathedral the view is no longer dominated@ by city church steeples but by an intrusive cacophony@ of drab characterless sixties boxes
1158,one building stands out in@ this@ dispiriting panorama of post-war mediocrity a dark@ powerful@ mass of brickwork with a tall central tower that stands@ right across the thames from wren's dome
1159,this@ is not an office block nor a church although its sublime form might suggest@ that its architect was adept at@ designing cathedrals
1160,it is in@ fact the now redundant oil-fired electric power station that sits@ on bankside next to the site of sam wanamaker's new globe theatre
1161,bankside power station should never have been built
1162,its architect had spent@ the war years with fellow royal academicians planning the orderly and spacious london of the future free@ of smoke and industry
1163,but when asked in@ # to replace an old dirty power station that had been on the site since # he soon forgot@ such idealism and like any architect was glad to have@ the job
1164,the project was controversial and the power station was only permitted providing the smoke was clean and the building did not challenge@ the visual dominance of st paul's
1165,so the single chimney rose@ only to #ft some #ft below the height of the cross above the cathedral
1166,the irony is that had the tower been higher and had the teak scrubbers been less efficient the smoke would have gone@ straight up into the air
1167,as it was the smokeless shimmer of vapour was so cooled by cleaning that it drifted across the river to cause mischief@ with@ the leadwork on wren's great dome
1168,bankside power station should not have been built
1169,but as it was built it should not now be demolished
1170,that@ is because it is a magnificent structure the supreme architectural expression of the heroic@ monumental@ phase of power station design and the creation@ of a great@ architect
1171,bankside was the work of sir giles gilbert scott om the architect of liverpool's anglican cathedral the rebuilt house of commons and some of the last vital@ products of the gothic revival
1172,he was a designer of extraordinary versatility being responsible for the standard traditional red telephone kiosk waterloo bridge and several power stations
1173,bankside represents the fullest@ realisation of his industrial aesthetic
1174,scott's first venture into@ this@ unlikely field@ of design was at battersea where in@ # he was wheeled@ in@ as a famous knighted architect by the london power@ company to try to make@ acceptable the coal-fired monster power station to@ which the residents of chelsea and westminster were taking@ strong@ exception
1175,this@ was a brilliant@ move@ 
1176,scott was so successful in@ styling the building in@ fine brickwork with jazz-modern fluting as john betjeman called it that when the battersea a station was opened@ in@ # it was widely acclaimed as a supremely successful modern treatment of a building type that seemed quintessentially twentieth century
1177,when in@ # the architects' journal conducted@ a survey@ to find@ what were considered@ the best modern buildings in britain battersea was placed@ second and was the favourite of such unlikely celebrities as sir kenneth clark rebecca west and charles laughton
1178,scott was so pleased with@ the style he had evolved@ at battersea a treatmentthat humanised@ industrial forms without@ denying their function that he also used it on the guinness factory at park royal west london
1179,at battersea scott could not alter the basic design of the building and he much disliked the upturned@ table@ created by the four corner chimneys
1180,at bankside however he was able to persuade the engineers mott hay & anderson to gather@ all the flues into a single slender@ tower or campanile
1181,as a result he was able to create a symmetrical monumental composition of great@ power@ 
1182,as at all his power stations scott faced@ the building in a fine worcestershire brick that has weathered to@ a lovely pinky-brown
1183,but there is nothing homely about@ the general effect
1184,vast overlapping planes of brickwork are modelled with careful set-backs and subtle bands of detail
1185,the result is an expression of the monumental@ aesthetic of the early twentieth century with@ strong@ american overtones
1186,when the campanile is seen from a distance it seems to belong to@ some strange expressionist church one has not noticed before
1187,not for nothing were such power stations described as brick cathedrals@ bankside is the finest manifestation of this@ tradition
1188,now it is redundant
1189,smoke shimmers no longer from the tall tower
1190,but bankside is nevertheless a sound@ structure which like the best mills of the industrial revolution is well worth@ preserving and is perfectly capable@ of adaptation for a new commercial use
1191,such re-use is of course much encouraged@ by a building being listed something which until@ recently was not possible with@ architecture of so recent a date
1192,two years ago however the department of the environment at last began@ the listing of post-war buildings in england that were more than # years old
1193,bracken house the former home@ of the financial times became the first candidate@ and english heritage then submitted@ some # recommendations to@ the department of the environment these included@ bankside
1194,this@ however was too much for the government and using the excuse that public opinion was not yet ready@ to accept@ the protection of many unpopular modern buildings lord caithness the minister of state for the environment arbitrarily whittled down english heritage's list to@ # buildings excluding bankside although it represented a more traditional approach@ in@ the fifties to@ the now-unfashionable modern movement@ 
1195,however caithness himself stated that this@ first selection was in@ no way@ a definitive list
1196,i have@ no doubt that others will be added
1197,the important thing@ is that the thirty year rule@ is in@ force@ and that we can respond@ to@ developing perceptions of our times
1198,earlier this@ year in@ my capacity@ as chairman of the thirties society i asked caithness's successor virginia bottomley to reconsider english heritage's recommendation of bankside for listing
1199,my argument was that as michael heseltine had so boldly@ listed battersea power station in@ # it was illogical not to protect a much finer and more complete industrial work by the same architect
1200,furthermore the listing of battersea had ensured the building's survival for conversion to@ a new use in@ that@ case as an entertainment centre@ which the prime minister herself had praised@ and inaugurated
1201,after@ two months' silence i was informed that ministers stood@ by their decision
1202,i wrote back asking@ the reasons for this@ pointing@ out@ that if any large modern power station deserved@ to be listed it was bankside
1203,i have received no satisfactory reply
1204,of course i know perfectly well why the department of the environment declines@ to list it
1205,listed building procedures might impede the full@ commercial realisation of the site when the electricity industry is privatised
1206,furthermore british rail has@ its eyes@ on@ the bankside site for bringing up the spoil from the tunnel for channel traffic which it is so absurdly driving@ under the middle of london at@ astronomical@ cost
1207,listing in@ theory is an objective assessment@ of architectural or historical importance which does not necessarily prevent demolition
1208,in@ the case of bankside power station the ultimate temple@ of power@ and a masterpiece of industrial architecture by a major twentieth-century british architect our historic building system@ is being perverted for purely political reasons

1232,as we know truth is often stranger than fiction
1233,often
1234,most of us prefer to watch dallas than our neighbours' home-movies because when it comes down to it we know that truth is generally a lot duller@ than fiction
1235,occasionally though a dramatist will uncover@ someone with@ an interesting story regardless of how unknown or vaguely remembered the subject@ is
1236,how many of us can now recall@ the real maria von trapp or fanny brice
1237,they live@ only through@ the sound of music and funny girl
1238,buddy holly comes@ somewhere between@ the subjects@ of those@ and more parasitic@ biographies
1239,his records are still played but his personality unexposed@ through@ movies or extensive@ tv interviews is almost entirely unknown
1240,it is in@ theory the best of both worlds@ except that buddy holly by all accounts@ was not terribly@ interesting
1241,he was born in lubbock married a nice spanish girl and died young in@ a plane crash in@ #
1242,all that counts@ are the records a rhythmically unusual tex-mex fusion@ of rock'n'roll and older western elements@ pioneering@ what became the standard pop instrumentation of two guitars bass and drums
1243,the lyrics are another matter
1244,of the two prototype rock songwriters it's the more worldly chuck berry you turn@ to@ for the authentic picture@ of teenage pleasures in eisenhower's america gonna write a little letter gonna mail it to my local deejay
1245,or cruising@ and playing the radio with@ no particular place to go
1246,berry's songs are plausible emblems@ of rock'n'roll rebellion@ or at@ any rate@ youthful hedonism
1247,buddy invites@ us to regard@ holly in@ the same light@ mocking in@ a horribly nudging@ re-creation lubbock old-timers like the hayriders who sing when the sun goes down on blue ridge mountain it's the time to whistle in your ear
1248,at least this@ has a surreal daftness
1249,the voice@ of rock'n'roll in@ contrast@ is almost unrelievedly soupy@ 
1250,if you didn't know the tunes you'd assume@ holly's lyrics decorated@ some innocent backporch spooners from@ the turn@ stars appear and the shadows are fallin'@ you can hear my honey@ callin'
1251,or you give@ me all your lovin' and your turtle-dovin'@ 
1252,or when cupid@ shot@ his@ dart@ he@ shot@ it@ at@ your@ heart@ 
1253,not only are these@ songs impossible to use dramatically they're also too vague@ to use as incidental music to underline@ or punctuate@ aspects@ of holly's life or the # more generally
1254,i wrote it for you he assures his gal before@ the ballads but how can you tell
1255,all you can do with@ these@ songs is sing them and buddy fails@ even to manage that@ with@ any subtlety
1256,the finales to@ both acts are effectively concerts the sort of agreeably naff rock'n'roll revival that might just about pass@ muster@ as a capital@ gold@ one-nighter down@ the hammersmith palais
1257,and for all the appeal@ of his singing and playing paul hipp comes@ out@ pretty dull@ between@ the numbers
1258,to camouflage@ the failures@ of the play andy walmsley has created a set which resembles a pile-up of roadside hoardings oldsmobile van heusen shirts texaco premium type
1259,rob bettinson the director has deduced that he ought to have these@ images plus disc-jockeys radio commercials midwestern hops but he doesn't seem to know why
1260,like most shows which are manufactured@ with@ an eye@ to@ commercial success winnie high@ society to name@ only buddy's predecessors@ at the victoria palace this@ one will probably fail@ 
1261,it's not as if there aren't aspects@ of his career that aren't worth@ exploring@ how did he come to use drums then almost unknown in texan country line-ups
1262,was it true@ as the chart performance@ of heartbeat his last release@ suggests@ that his three-year career was already on@ the wane@ 
1263,and surely any dramatist ought to be able to move@ us with@ that@ final night of holly's life when his musicians including waylon jennings gave their places on the plane to the big bopper and ritchie valens
1264,the author's job is not merely to offer an illustrated@ who's who entry but to turn@ elements@ of a man's life into@ a dramatic entity
1265,and if holly's too boring for that@ perhaps the best approach@ would be to write about@ his impact@ on@ others

1276,while the first wave@ of popular interest arose@ with@ the # whitechapel exhibition instigated by laura mulvey and peter wollen it was the publication of hayden herrera's biography of kahlo in@ # which has led@ to@ her current cult status

1278,in@ may # magazine ran@ a # page feature on@ frida kahlo as the spirit@ of mexico fig # while in@ feb # there was a # page interpretation of the romance of frida kahlo's mexico fig #
1279,almost as a logical outcome of this@ media blitz@ it emerged@ in@ the summer of # that madonna already a devotee@ of kahlo's work was commissioning a screenplay based@ on@ kahlo's life 
1280,
1281, may # p ##
1282,as with@ most artists who have become mythical@ personalities in@ the popular imagination such attention has focused@ primarily on@ the anecdotal and tragic@ details of kahlo's admittedly fascinating life
1283,the passionate obsession with@ her husband diego rivera her flamboyant appearance but most of all her physical and emotional pain have come@ to dominate@ responses@ to@ her work
1284,while kahlo's art helped@ her to deal@ with@ the vicissitudes of her life for most audiences@ it is her life story which allows@ access@ to@ her art
1285,in@ this@ one can draw@ obvious parallels@ to@ the appeal@ of van gogh a traditionally popular artist recently made@ fashionable bythe media attention generated@ during the centennial of his death
1286,the archetypal dropout spiritualist became an appropriate icon@ for the sixties revival of #'s@ long@ hot summer

1288,in@ the case of kahlo the popular image@ is of the artist herself the characteristic brows the elaborate hair the mexican costume fig #
1289,it is primarily her appearance not the formal@ language@ of her art that has graced@ the pages of and magazines
1290,the feature transposed@ the kahlo style to@ kahlo lookalikes in@ contemporary clothing balanced@ around@ segments@ of herrera's biography of the artist
1291,in@ the later piece@ only the style remained as the far@ more overtly sexual kahloesque models@ lounged and pouted in their mexican interiors
1292,there is a poignant irony in@ the way@ clothing which on@ one level@ served@ to hide kahlo's broken@ body falls or is lifted by the model@ to reveal a luxuriantly perfect physique fig #
1293,the visual references in@ the two magazines are as much from@ photos of the artist as from@ her work
1294,in@ both features she is also seen@ to embody a wider@ set@ of assumptions about@ mexico itself exotic passionate yet constantly struggling@ against@ pain and deceit
1295,while and subsequently fig # stressed@ different facets@ of kahlo's public persona they all shared@ the emphasis@ on@ her an encapsulisation@ of stereotypical@ images@ of mexico@ rather than her work
1296,it is her body the canvas@ her appearance art@ 
1297,the art of self-expression becomes self-expression as art

1302,of course the line@ between@ art and life is a particularly hard@ one to draw@ in@ kahlo's case
1303,the majority of her work is self portraiture her aesthetic concerns grew@ from@ her fascination with@ the falsity of appearance
1304,dressing up role playing and masquerade form the conceptual basis of kahlo's work
1305,in@ # fig # she paints herself wearing rivera's suit challenging@ traditional expectations of femininity and attempting to appropriate@ his authority while simultaneously threatening castration
1306,more disturbingly in@ # fig # she throws@ doubt on@ too straightforward a reading@ of her self-portraits as revealing@ of her inner@ emotions
1307,where@ does the mask@ fall@ does not the ritual@ repetition of those@ familiar features@ mask@ far more than it uncovers@ 
1308,there is however an inevitable logic to@ the appropriation@ of her meticulously constructed@ image@ a process which the artist was mocking as early as # some of the gringa women are imitating me and trying to dress a la mexicana but the poor@ souls only look cabbages@ and to tell you the naked@ truth they look absolutely impossible'
1309,the impossibility@ stemmed@ from@ the failure of such followers to recognise@ the symbolic importance of kahlo's choice of clothing a failure also intrinsic to@ her recent magazine appearances
1310,the particularities of post-revolutionary mexico are frequently subsumed by the decorativeness of the ethnic by the generalised attractiveness@ of the radical avant-garde
1311,for kahlo however choosing@ to don the costume of the tehuana as for example in@ # fig # was to embody a powerful@ icon@ of cultural identity
1312,mexican indian dress is extraordinarily diverse and by and large geographically specific varying from@ region to@ region
1313,the tehuana dress is by no means the most decorative variant or the closest@ to@ pre-hispanic forms@ of clothing
1314,it is the mythology surrounding@ the women wearers of the costume which directed@ kahlo's choice
1315,the ostensibly matriarchal society of tehuantepec led@ to@ the adoption@ of the tehuana in post-revolutionary mexico as the image@ of the strong indian woman the undefeated counterpart to@ the despised chingada who conversely is the female embodiment of mexico's hybrid@ post-conquest culture
1316,in@ a culture where@ sexual metaphors are frequently usedto convey@ racial and political conflict the tehuana represents@ that@ aspect@ of mexico's indigenous@ tradition unbowed@ by centuries of colonial and male rule@ 
1317,kahlo's adoption@ of tehuana dress while being an attractive@ disguise@ of what she saw@ as a less than perfect body asserted@ both a feminist and an anti-colonialist position@

1322,in@ kahlo's work there is a powerful@ mix@ of these@ discourses yet her role@ as an archetypal woman painter has come@ to dominate@ responses to@ her work

1338,this@ appropriateness of kahlo's aesthetic to@ contemporary debate has tended to remove@ her work from@ its historical context@ to stress@ the collective and the cross-cultural
1339,although this@ is not in@ itself to be dismissed@ as a tactic@ it has diminished the complexity of kahlo's achievement as a specifically mexican painter operating@ within@ the particularities of her historical moment
1340,more problematic is the way@ in@ which such a dislocation@ has led@ to@ the acceptance of her mexicanness as mere decoration@ of the essentially feminist themes of her work thereby defusing@ a substantial part@ of the art described by breton a ribbon@ round@ a bomb@ 
1341,it is the ribbon@ that runs@ through@ the pages of the glossy surface of the images in@ direct@ opposition to@ a work such as kahlo's # fig #
1342,in@ this@ painting a memorial to@ a woman's tragic@ death is transformed into@ an indictment@ of the culture@ which destroyed@ her
1343,hale's suicide became a poignant metaphor for the oppressive nature@ of the social values@ of new york and north america in general
1344,the story behind@ hale's death was one with@ which kahlo obviously identified@ and within@ which dress formed an important symbolic function
1345,before@ jumping from the window of her apartment hale had dressed meticulously in her most flattering dress the corsage of yellow roses a gift from a male admirer
1346,in@ kahlo's painting the figure falls@ from@ the fantasy world@ she has inhabited@ to@ the harsh@ bloodspattered@ reality of the street literally coming down to earth
1347,hale's eyes stare@ knowingly@ at@ the viewer a human sacrifice@ to@ an alienated@ and consumerist culture@ 
1348,the horizontality of her fallen body is juxtaposed to@ the vertical thrust@ of the apartment building
1349,she leaps@ from@ an architectural monument to@ a phallocentric world@ 
1350,although destroyed she has also escaped
1351,the painting dedicated to@ hale's mother was commissioned by a mutual friend of kahlo and dorothy hale the managing editor of clare boothe luce
1352,the painting was agreed to@ by luce in part to recompense for what she saw@ as her misjudgment of her dead friend
1353,having lent hale money to pay her rent she had been angered to discover@ her spending enormous sums on@ an haute-couture dress and refused to turn@ up@ what in@ retrospect became hale's farewell party
1354,later it was revealed@ that the money had come@ from a different source@ 
1355,a male friend had tried to dissuade hale from@ seeking a much needed job and had given her a thousand dollars to buy the most beautiful dress in new york telling her that what she needed was to find a rich husband
1356,on@ one level@ this@ work deals@ with@ a generalised woman's experience yet the metaphorical power@ of dorothy hale's dress derives@ from@ kahlo's useof clothing in@ her own self-portraits
1357,dress not only covers and decorates the body but instils in@ the wearer its own characteristic strengths@ and weaknesses@ 
1358,hale's black velvet dress is cursed because it represents the values@ of the gringolandia so hated by kahlo

1362,the inner@ frida is controlled@ bymodern society far@ more than the clothed frida who often marks@ her deviation from@ the norm bydefiantly returning@ the gaze of the viewer
1363,kahlo's naked body becomes not just the tortured self of her personal biography but a visual counterpart to@ the injured@ and defiled@ manifestations of mexico's colonised@ past la llorona the weeping woman of popular myth and la chingada the raped and abused mother described in@ paz's

1414,brutality as hill describes and felt@ it was a bitter@ part@ of his prison life you just learnt to get down on the floor as fast as you could and cover up as best you could
1415,but it was gerry conlon's account@ of being interrogated after@ the guildford bombings that made@ the scalp crawl@ 
1416,we know your mother works at the royal victoria hospital they told him we know where your sister works and there are sectarian killings down@ there
1417,they told me they could arrange@ an accident
1418,and i believed they were capable of murdering my mother i honestly believe they would have murdered my mother that@'s why i signed the statement
1419,the account@ he gave@ just after@ his release was that the threat had been that a british soldier might accidentally shoot one of the women

1493,#comment the guardianwednesday november # # more than just another disaster
1494,thirty five people died and others were maimed for life in@ the clapham rail disaster in@ december last year because work was done in@ a slovenly haphazard way@ and was then left@ unchecked
1495,the disaster was all the more stunning because people had come@ to assume@ that such things@ didn't happen
1496,in@ most years rail deaths are few in@ some there are none at all
1497,clapham indeed accounts for nearly half@ the # fatalities of the last ten years compare that@ with@ the # deaths and # injuries every year on the roads
1498,yet yesterday's report on@ the clapham crash confirming the picture@ which emerged@ throughout@ the hidden inquiry makes@ an event which seemed at@ the time totally unexpected look@ almost inevitable
1499,this@ was a system@ hopelessly@ under@ strain@ 
1500,under@ strain@ for a start@ because it was technically ill-equipped@ to avert@ disaster or to cope@ with@ the consequences when disaster struck@ under@ strain@ from@ commercial pressures@ which as the inquiry puts@ it compromised@ safety under@ strain@ above@ all because the people on the spot couldn't or wouldn't cope were weary from@ gruesome working hours the senior@ signal technician who heads@ the list of the culpable had had@ only one day off@ in@ the past # weeks lacked adequate training@ or simply couldn't be bothered
1501,the bulk@ of the blame for all that@ is placed@ on@ british rail which knowingly@ permitted@ these@ things@ to continue
1502,though individuals are nailed@ the greatest@ villain@ of all is the system@ 
1503,in@ a desperately@ competitive@ climate@ where@ anyone bright@ and competent could go@ down@ the road@ and pick@ up@ a better paid job with@ kinder@ hours and more congenial working conditions from@ someone@ like british telecom the railways ran@ a service dependent on@ people who belonged to@ a narrow@ and inbred@ working culture@ with@ outdated procedures of training@ and promotion and an institutional reliance on@ overtime working whose wholly disgraceful dimensions@ are symbolised@ by the fact that maximum weekly hours were only recently cut@ to@ # hours a week
1504,the transport secretary mr cecil parkinson assured the commons yesterday that financial considerations would not stand@ in@ the way@ of implementing sir anthony hidden's # recommendations
1505,on@ the technical side@ remedial work is in@ many cases already on@ the way@ 
1506,but the job of lifting@ the standards@ of people employed giving@ them proper training@ and paying a wage which breaks@ dependence on@ overtime and lifts@ morale this@ together@ must far@ exceed@ the costs of the technology and it isn't by any means@ clear@ what the bill will be or where@ the money will come@ from@ 
1507,all of which is not just a problem for a properly penitent@ british rail it's a problem for government too
1508,government fixes@ the format@ in@ which br has to work@ and if as the hidden report attests@ many of its problems today reflect@ lack of past planning lack of farsighted@ investment living@ from@ hand@ to@ mouth@ then that@ is not just br's doing@ 
1509,government compounds@ all these@ problems when it sets@ down@ working parameters which fail@ to reflect@ the value@ the country gets@ from@ a system@ that is run@ efficiently can shift@ people to destinations with@ exemplary speed and safety as europe consistently demonstrates@ 
1510,it is sad@ and somewhat ominous that so little of that@ should have been reflected@ in@ the sombre@ statement which mr parkinson made@ in the house yesterday
1511,a service in@ chaos
1512,the nation's ambulance service was in@ manifest chaos yesterday
1513,there was no service in london with@ all # stations and # vehicles off@ the@ road@ 
1514,the only accident and emergency relief@ was provided by the police part-time st john ambulance volunteers running # vehicles and the red cross
1515,outside the capital accident and emergency services were being provided in most areas but the ban on@ emergency work was tightened@ 
1516,the service was facing@ its biggest@ crisis@ since the ambulances came@ to@ a stop in@ the winter of discontent ten years ago
1517,like labour in@ # the conservatives have put@ military ambulances on@ standby
1518,they move in today
1519,what has gone@ wrong
1520,there are three key causes of the shambles@ mr kenneth clarke the failure to separate@ emergency from@ non-emergency work and the whitley council negotiating machinery@ 
1521,the health secretary accused@ the unions of posturing@ and pretending@ to run@ a # service yesterday
1522,he was right
1523,by refusing to keep@ open@ two-way@ radio links@ the crews had effectively ended a proper emergency service
1524,the move@ was signalled@ last week and true@ to@ their promised response@ management suspended@ the workers involved in@ the disruption
1525,but posturing@ and pretending@ went@ far@ beyond@ the unions
1526,mr clarke has been indulging in@ just that@ himself putting@ up@ the luckless duncan nichol chief executive of the health service to take@ the initial flak@ under@ the pretence that the dispute is not his direct@ responsibility
1527,yet it was mr clarke not mr nichol who was involved in@ the critical@ decisions the cash limit@ for the nhs the # per cent offer to@ ambulance workers compared@ to@ seven per cent for nurses eight per cent for doctors and nine per cent for ancillary workers and today's introduction@ of military ambulances
1528,ambulance workers on@ emergency work do deserve a much higher@ increase
1529,they have progressed@ far@ beyond@ routine first aid
1530,their paramedical skills cover@ highly technical procedures intubation infusion and defebrillation
1531,the crews@ are able@ to resuscitate heart attack patients replace fluid intraveneously after@ severe@ blood loss and insert tubes to maintain air supplies in unconconscious casualties
1532,yet the ambulance worker is only being offered # when a fire officer is being given # and a metropolitan police constable can earn #
1533,but only two million out of@ the # million journeys which ambulance crews@ carry@ out@ each year are emergency calls
1534,nine out of@ # are routine calls@ many of which could be carried@ out@ by mini cabs
1535,mr duncan nichol wants to separate@ the emergency from@ the non-emergency work
1536,he is right to pursue@ this@ line@ 
1537,wiltshire and northumbria have already shown@ how much can be achieved
1538,the ramshackle@ whitley council negotiating machinery@ is the other reason why the ambulance workers have lost out
1539,until@ this@ year the three independent review bodies@ which make@ recommendations for nurses doctors and the professions allied@ to@ medicine have given@ much higher@ awards than the whitley councils
1540,as lord mccarthy noted@ some # years ago the management side@ of the councils comprise employers who do not pay and paymasters who do not employ
1541,a much more flexible@ system@ which would allow@ local managers to negotiate local rates on@ a national pay spine@ is needed
1542,a crisis@ an agenda@ for reform and honesty
1543,one mr clarke cannot duck@ away from@ if he wants to avoid@ a second winter of discontent

1547,the hong kong university of science and technology the hong kong island divisional headquarters@ of the red cross the new cultural centre@ and many more
1548,he is even re-opening the already opened@ eastern harbour tunnel and subway crossing
1549,it is all standard royal stuff@ but not much help to@ the millions who fear that hong kong will not remain open@ after@ #
1550,the whole@ point@ of a visit to hong kong now five months after@ tiananmen square should be to declare with@ royal authority that britain shares@ the concerns of the hong kong people and is determined@ to do@ something about@ them
1551,there was already a rather perfunctory air@ to@ the queen's visit three years ago as if it were just a required coda@ to@ her tour of china
1552,when the prince and princess of wales quite rightly scrapped@ their tour of the mainland they had@ the opportunity to make@ a contrasting@ point@ in hong kong
1553,unless they can say something relevant in@ the next@ four days the many hong kong critics who believe the visit is a waste@ of dollars will be absolutely right
1554,it did not help at all that upon@ arrival yesterday the royal couple instantly touched@ base@ in that@ comforting symbol@ of past british power@ the hong kong and shanghai bank
1555,if there is a failure@ of imagination to use the royal visit creatively it will also be a failure@ of nerve
1556,britain still cannot decide@ when to play@ the mandarinate game@ of silence with@ the chinese and when to break@ the rules@ as beijing does all the time
1557,the ideal tactics@ should be a mixture@ of both but only if a clear@ message@ can be communicated@ to@ the hong kong people that someone is standing@ up@ for them somewhere
1558,instead the latest developments in@ sino-british relations have left@ them even more confused than before@ 
1559,china claims@ that the hong kong government recently gave@ a written commitment to limit@ the activities of the pro-democracy movement@ in the territory
1560,the government denies@ this@ but has published@ the text of a letter fromits political adviser to@ the new china news agency beijing's embassy in hong kong suggesting@ that it did
1561,in@ a tone@ of meek@ appeasement@ the letter draws@ attention to@ the arrest by hong kong police of anti-china demonstrators outside the agency's national day reception
1562,it also reminds@ beijing that permission has been refused for local protesters to erect a replica statue of democracy on a permanent site
1563,it ends by assuring@ beijing that the hong kong government will have@ a prudent@ regard for the special circumstances of hong kong and the interests and concerns of the chinese government
1564,meanwhile the flood@ of letters of a very different sort from@ anxious hong kong citizens to@ this@ and every other newspaper office continues
1565,so do the chinese press statements asserting@ that hong kong is entirely a business@ between@ china and britain and should not be discussed@ formally or informally at@ any international forum@ 
1566,the only two hong kong legislators who consistently dare to speak out mr martin lee and mr szeto wah have been threatened with@ expulsion@ from@ the committee now drafting china's post-# basic law
1567,our latest foreign secretary has yet to publicly pick up the file marked hong kong

1574,if a dwelling house is in@ such a state of disrepair as to be prejudicial to@ health or a nuisance the tenant may lay@ an information against@ his landlord alleging the existence of a statutory nuisance under@ the public health act #
1575,the tenant is not obliged to ensure that the landlord is aware of the defects in the premises or to give@ the landlord an opportunity to remedy the defects before@ commencing legal proceedings
1576,although that@ is the position@ in@ law the court emphasised@ that as a matter of commonsense@ a tenant should first complain to@ the landlord before@ exercising@ the right to prosecute
1577,the facts
1578,mrs bujok and her family occupied a house as council tenants
1579,in@ september # mrs bujok laid@ an information against@ the council alleging the existence and continuance of a statutory nuisance under@ section@ # of the public health act #
1580,it was alleged that the council being the owners of the premises were the persons by whose act default or sufferance the nuisance arose@ 
1581,prior to laying@ the information mrs bujok had not served@ an abatement notice upon@ the council or informed them of the alleged defects in the premises
1582,the justices held@ mrs bujok was not required to ensure that the council were aware of the defective stateof@ the property prior to laying@ the information
1583,the council appealed@ by case stated
1584,the legislation
1585,section@ # of the # act defines@ statutory nuisances as any premises in@ such a stateas to be prejudicial to@ health or a nuisance
1586,the decision
1587,mr justice hutchison said the # act primarily envisages@ a system@ where@ the local authority has@ a power@ and a duty to try@ to secure@ that premises are not in@ a state which constitutes a statutory nuisance
1588,action@ is initiated@ by the service@ of an abatement notice requiring remedial@ work
1589,if the person in@ default fails to comply with@ an abatement notice the localauthority is obliged@ to make@ a complaint to@ the magistrates
1590,if the complaint is proved a nuisance order is made@ requiring the defendant to get@ the necessary work done
1591,effectively the sequence is that the person in@ default is told what is wrong and is required to put@ it right
1592,he is given@ an opportunity to do so and if he does not he is subject to sanctions by the court to compel him to do so
1593,the problem arises@ in connection with section@ # which adapts@ or applies@ the provisions to@ cases where@ an individual rather than the local authority wishes to make@ the complaint
1594,need he serve@ an abatement notice
1595,the authorities plainly@ establish that he need not and cannot do so
1596,does that@ mean@ he may lay@ an information and bring@ the matter before@ the magistrates without@ first putting@ the person alleged to be in@ default on@ notice of what is alleged
1597,the council argued@ that a landlord particularly one such as a local authority cannot realistically be expected to have@ a system@ of inspection of all its premises and in@ practice is entitled@ to depend upon@ notification by its tenants
1598,for mrs bujok it was argued that the # act was designed@ to secure@ in@ the interests@ of the community@ at large that statutory nuisances did not exist
1599,it was submitted that an owner cannot turn@ his back@ on@ his property because when he purchases and takes on the responsibility of letting he knows the property will in@ the course@ of time deteriorate
1600,he must therefore satisfy himself on@ a regular@ basis that it does not constitute a statutory nuisance
1601,in@ warner v lambeth london borough council # # hlr # # lord justice glidewell said a private person could lay@ an information alleging the failure to abate a statutory nuisance without@ first giving@ notice requiring abatement
1602,therefore in@ the present case the justices came@ to@ the correct conclusion
1603,his lordship reached@ that@ decision without@ enthusiasm because it seemed that as a matter of common sense@ notice should be given@ in@ such circumstances before criminal proceedings were launched@ 
1604,lord justice watkins said he agreedwith@ reluctance
1605,it was surely repugnant to@ commonsense@ that in@ this@ area@ of legal activity a local authority should be prosecuted by one of its tenants without@ first being given@ the opportunity by that tenant to remedy the consequences of a neglect to repair the dwelling that the tenant occupied
1606,in@ law there was no doubt that mrs bujok was entitled@ to commence proceedings without@ giving@ notice of the state of the dwelling to@ the council
1607,but in@ every other conceivable way@ that@ action@ was entirely wrong
1608,endless trouble to@ many people in@ courts and council offices@ and much money could be saved@ by the giving@ of notice of disrepair
1609,if the council did not react@ to@ that@ notice then would be the time for the tenant to exercise@ the right to prosecute
1610,parliament should give@ fresh@ thought to@ enacting@ a provision placing@ an obligation upon@ a council tenant to give@ notice to@ the council before@ being permitted to commence proceedings

1616,leinster have named a team@ that looks@ strong@ on@ paper@ including eight internationals yet they recently lost@ to@ both munster and ulster in@ the inter-provincial championship
1617,such is the mood of@ pessimism here it is hard@ to find anyone who believes the all blacks having won their seven matches in wales will face@ any significant threat@ during the next@ fortnight
1618,ulster the provincial champions may well fancy their chances on@ november # but leinster look@ certain to face@ an uphill@ struggle@ even though the tourists@ have rested # of the team@ that beat@ wales
1619,leinster will be hard@ pushed to keep@ the score@ within@ the respectable@ margins@ of@ defeat set@ by their predecessors@ 
1620,in@ # the all blacks defeated leinster #-# they won #-# in@ # and scraped@ home@ #-# in@ #
1621,however during the eighties irish provincial rugby has assumed a third@ world@ status@ in relation to new zealand's
1622,leinster have been undermined@ by their failure to secure@ prestige fixtures@ since the mid-seventies
1623,when new zealand last toured ireland in@ # leinster were ignored@ 
1624,the same thing@ happened in@ # when the province was denied@ a fixture@ against@ the wallabies
1625,such neglect has done@ nothing for@ their confidence
1626,even so the all blacks who include seven capped players will give@ today's opponents due respect
1627,as their coach@ alex wyllie remarked when we arrived in wales we were told cardiff were no damned good and look@ how well they played against@ us
1628,leinster are quite capable of@ doing the same
1629,wyllie is confident his western samoan wing@ va'aiga tuigamala will play although he is still niggled by an ankle injury received against@ neath two weeks ago
1630,the test flanker alan whetton whose hamstring injury kept@ him out@ against@ wales will form@ a powerful@ back row with kevin schuler and the international no# zinzan brooke
1631,the tourists@ will field four backs aged # or under@ 
1632,for@ their part@ leinster are boosted@ by the presence of@ four players already selected for@ ireland to play new zealand in dublin on@ november #
1633,they are brendan mullin the lions centre fergus aherne the scrum-half and the two new caps nick popplewell at loose-head and brian smith the fly-half
1634,no doubt smith the oxford university australian who won five caps for@ the wallabies will feel@ a bit closer@ to home@ facing@ the all blacks twice in@ the next@ # days
1635,it will be fascinating to see@ how smith a gifted all-round footballer shapes up in@ his prospective international partnership with@ aherne
1636,equally intriguing will be the line-out performance of@ the young london irish lock@ neil francis who has been left out ofthe current ireland squad@ 
1637,fortunately leinster's front five which includes the experienced tight-head prop@ des fitzgerald looks@ up@ to@ the task of@ scrummaging against@ the all blacks

1704,prototyping is crucial to@ systems development argues ian richards tailored@ to fit@ 
1705,in@ systemsdevelopment nothing is more fundamental than assessing@ user requirements
1706,if you don't know what the system is required to do@ you don't know anything
1707,but many system developers are unable to assess@ requirements properly
1708,they seem to think that you can ask a businessman what his requirements are and get@ an answer that amounts@ to@ a draft system specification
1709,a doctor@ doesn't ask@ his patient@ what treatment@ to prescribe@ 
1710,the patient@ can explain@ only what the problem@ is
1711,it is the doctor@ that provides@ the remedy@ 
1712,if you ask a user what sort of system he wants you will be met@ with@ a blank@ look
1713,a user may have@ a deep@ knowledge of business problems but knowing little about@ computers has@ no idea how they should be tackled@ 
1714,yet analysts are heard asking time and again tell me what you want
1715,we've gone@ away@ from@ the days of systemsimposed@ by the data processing department this@ is going to be a systemfor the users
1716,but of course the users don't know what they want so they end up getting another duff system
1717,an effective analyst provides the same service@ to@ the business the doctor@ provides@ to@ the patient@ 
1718,he finds out what the needs@ of the business are and prescribes@ the cure@ 
1719,the user tells the analyst what the problems are and the analyst decides at least in@ broad@ terms@ what the user requires
1720,but the analyst has@ one great@ advantage over@ the doctor
1721,once the user becomes familiar@ with@ the proposed system helpful@ comments come@ thick@ and fast@ 
1722,oh this@ will be of great@ help in@ ordering raw@ materials but sometimes we get part deliveries could we have@ an extra facility@ to deal@ with@ those@ 
1723,and sometimes non-standard discount is given@ a pig@ to deal@ with@ on@ the old system but if you could add one extra input@ box@ on@ that screen there
1724,and what about@ orders not delivered on@ time
1725,if we could list those@ we'd have@ advance warning of shortage problems on@ the assembly lines two months before they occur
1726,now that@ would be a great@ leap@ forward@ 
1727,unfortunately you cannot reach@ this@ stage@ until@ you have developed a prototype system
1728,and you can't develop a prototype systembecause the users haven't got@ a clue@ what they want
1729,most of them are probably muttering i'm too busy to get involved in@ this sort of thing@ 
1730,what's wrong with@ the old system anyway
1731,the only way@ to develop a prototype is for the analyst to get@ inside@ the head of the user and thinking like a user decide what sort of system is required
1732,of course the initial system will not be perfect
1733,the analyst cannot hope to understand the business as well in@ a few weeks as the user does after@ many years
1734,but once the user sees@ the system channels@ of communication will open@ 
1735,instead of persuading the user to specify requirements the analyst will be driven@ by the user to meet@ key needs
1736,good system development goes@ through@ two distinct@ phases@ 
1737,initially the analyst does all the work leading@ the user towards@ a systemhe thinks is right for the business
1738,but once the user sees@ the potential of the system a change@ in@ attitude@ takes@ place@ 
1739,the process becomes demand driven by the user
1740,the analyst is then forced@ on@ the defensive@ explaining why new@ features@ cannot be included because they are technically difficult or prohibitively@ expensive
1741,traditionally systems were validated by users agreeing functional specifications
1742,in@ theory validation meant@ that the user had read the specification imagined how the system would work@ in@ practice and agreed the design@ 
1743,it was only when using a test version of the system available just before@ the planned@ implementation date that difficulties would come@ to@ light@ and a host of change@ requests be issued
1744,the advent of fourth generation@ languages@ #gls has made@ system development much easier 
1745,with@ a #gl an initial prototype can be put@ together@ quickly
1746,this means@ feedback@ is obtained early in@ the development process and the system can grow@ around@ the user's requirements
1747,crucial to@ the development process is the relationship built@ up@ between@ the analyst and the user
1748,the best systems arise@ when both have@ a deep@ understanding of each other's jobs
1749,many developers use@ business analysts to ensure that the development team@ maintain@ a proper focus@ on@ business requirements
1750,but this@ can be counter-productive as it cuts@ off@ communication between@ the systemsanalyst and the user
1751,too much specialisation is bad for systemsdevelopment it feeds@ the temptation to get engrossed in@ technical difficulties and forget about@ the underlying@ business needs
1752,if you should stroll into a pub and meet an analyst and a user talking about@ work and you cannot tell@ one from@ the other they have probably developed a successful@ system together@

1806,ragazzi of@ distinction
1807,in@ december # the men working feverishly@ to create the first american atomic bomb sent a team@ of spooks@ to naples
1808,one of@ their main assignments was to contact edoardo amaldi a physicist thought to be in@ hiding near rome
1809,six months later the day before@ rome's liberation by the allies amaldi was found
1810,he was interviewed by moe berg then one of@ the most famous baseball players in america
1811,berg was also an agent of@ the office of@ strategic services which was later to give@ birth@ to@ the cia
1812,his job was to convince amaldi to pack@ his bags@ because there was a ship waiting@ at naples to take@ him to the united states
1813,amaldi's presence there@ had been sought by two other italian colleagues also physicists
1814,his mentor enrico fermi later to be called the father@ of@ the bomb and emilio segre who died in california earlier this@ year
1815,amaldi dodged@ the american invitation perhaps because with@ rome liberated fermi's mantle@ in@ physics had fallen@ on@ his young@ shoulders@ and there were younger@ minds to teach@ 
1816,he wore@ that@ mantle@ well at@ rome university until@ his retirement in@ #
1817,but amaldi never really retired@ nor grew old
1818,he kept@ regular@ hours in the university's physics building spoke at@ scientific meetings this@ year in moscow and washington
1819,as president of@ the accademia nazionale dei lincei he had delivered@ the welcoming address on@ tuesday to@ a symposium of@ scientists
1820,he then ordered a car to call@ for@ him the next@ morning for@ a similar occasion and was felled@ by a stroke@ while waiting for@ the lift
1821,amaldi grew up in a small town in lombardy and took@ his doctorate in@ physics from@ rome at@ the remarkably early age of@ #
1822,in@ # he became one of@ the ragazzi di via panisperna the street where fermi's kids carried out their own experiments under@ the master@ in their own under-financed lab
1823,emilio segre was one kid and bruno pontecorvo later to defect from britain to the soviet union another
1824,it is interesting to note@ that the pope@ as the kids called fermi because he's always right was only seven years older than amaldi
1825,amaldi astounded@ his group@ in@ october # with@ his discovery that by slowing down rather than accelerating neutrons he could provoke@ intense nuclear reactions
1826,he held@ a chair in@ physics from@ # until@ his retirement publishing more than # papers on@ atomic and nuclear physics
1827,he was awarded@ honorary degrees by algiers glasgow and oxford
1828,he became a founder and active executive of@ the european centre for nuclear research in geneva
1829,i had@ the pleasure of@ two long@ talks last year with@ professor amaldi about@ his knowledge of@ what the german physicists were doing with@ their atoms during the war years
1830,apart@ for@ his incongruously white hair amaldi seemed to have@ the mental lucidity and expected energy of@ a man half his age
1831,his modesty considering his world-wide fame in@ his field@ was endearing
1832,i knew almost nothing about@ physics but we shared@ some jokes about@ the rome telephone system

1838,the intifada is a people's unarmed@ revolution@ against@ occupation
1839,its two main slogans repeated countless times in@ the directives issued@ by the underground@ leadership are freedom@ and independence
1840,it has employed@ a dual strategy@ to achieve these@ two objectives@ 
1841,first a comprehensive civil disobedience campaign@ was begun by which people severed@ or minimised@ all the contact@ points@ by which they were bound@ to@ the israeli occupation authority
1842,this@ campaign@ included resignations of@ palestinian officials from@ public posts the boycott of@ israeli goods and products and the refusal to pay taxes and fines
1843,partial and full@ strikes@ demonstrations sit-ins conventions all these@ have in@ fact only constituted the outer@ layer@ of@ an inner@ mechanism@ of@ civilian rebellion
1844,the second and complementary part@ of@ the intifada strategy concentrated@ on@ the construction@ of@ an indigenous national authority
1845,as israel's authority was being lifted@ the population began creating an alternative authority of@ their own
1846,popular committees were established in villages refugee camps suburbs streets in@ fact in every community
1847,some headway@ was made@ in@ expanding@ self-sufficiency whether through@ utilising more land for@ agriculture developing home@ economies or encouraging@ local manufacturers and products
1848,villages and refugee camps were thus being developed into@ liberated@ or independent areas if not militarily then at least psychologically politically and infrastructurally
1849,bloody clashes@ would occur whenever armoured units raided these@ villages storming through makeshift defensive road blocks and responding@ to@ rocks being thrown with live@ bullets and tear gas but no sooner would these@ army units be gone@ than authority would revert to@ the village residents
1850,palestinian flags would be raised on minarets and church spires road blocks would again be erected and life in@ all its aspects@ would once again be run@ by the local leadership
1851,the structure@ of@ the developing national authority has been both diffuse@ enough to prevent it@ from@ being destroyed@ by any one single sweep@ of@ arrests there have been more than # arrests since the intifada's outbreak and coherent enough to allow@ for@ the existence of@ a unified resistance@ strategy
1852,while the entire network@ of@ popular committees local institutions and the general public the field@ commanders@ in@ the battle@ of@ civilian disobedience and of@ constructing@ a political infrastructure a rotating@ unified national command acts@ in@ the role@ of field-general issuing a bi-monthly directive outlining@ policy and determining specific resistance@ programmes
1853,a high@ level@ of@ mobility@ in@ the structure@ allows@ for@ continuous@ interchange@ of@ roles@ and ideas and retains@ for@ the unified national command the closeness@ to@ grass@ roots@ that is required to make@ it@ truly reflect@ people's wishes and sentiments
1854,this@ expanded@ network@ of@ popular committees and institutions making@ up@ the unified leadership is infused@ by tens of thousands of activists who belong@ to@ or identify@ with@ the different factions of@ the plo
1855,in@ effect therefore the plo exists@ at@ all levels@ of@ organisation within the occupied territories
1856,thus the palestinian national movement@ both inside and outside the occupied territories is an organic@ whole
1857,the pattern@ of@ the intifada has been cyclical
1858,thrusts@ of@ resistance@ mass demonstrations resignations tax rebellions etc would come@ in@ crests@ 
1859,the pattern@ is determined by a wide@ variety of@ factors including what the israeli army does@ 
1860,but the relation@ is complex not uni-directional@ 
1861,harsh@ measures@ putting@ an entire community under@ an absolute curfew for@ a continuous@ lengthy period of@ time demolishing homes uprooting olive or citrus trees physical intimidation and terror tacticsemployed@ by raiding army units shooting killing cutting@ off@ water or electricity supplies and telephone links@ to@ villages or towns mass arrests intimidatory interrogation techniques can either create a temporary lull or activate@ an eruption@ 
1862,the army never knows@ which it will be
1863,it is it is walking@ through@ a minefield@ 
1864,the wave@ pattern@ of@ the intifada its pains@ and sufferings@ are all of@ the process@ of@ birth@ 
1865,the metaphor is apt as palestinians regard@ themselves as engaging in@ a process of@ giving@ birth@ to@ their independent palestinian state
1866,through@ their revolution@ the masses@ are both mother@ and midwife@ to@ the birth@ of@ this@ state
1867,the intifada is the midwife@ of@ freedom@ 
1868,through@ it palestinians are struggling@ on@ a daily basis to shake@ off@ israel's authority and to construct@ their own
1869,the struggle@ reflects@ a revolution@ in@ mass consciousness@ by which people have come@ to realise that ideas and aspirations must be embodied in@ manifest acts if reality is to be changed@ 
1870,thus wherever one looks@ one finds@ people engaged in@ the construction@ of@ the blocks@ that will make@ up@ the palestinian state
1871,it is a conscious@ effort
1872,the masses@ are being engaged in@ the craft@ of@ state-masonry@ 
1873,in@ this@ process of@ state building@ many stages@ have been covered@ 
1874,the declaration of independence issued@ by the palestine national council pnc on@ november # last year constitutes a major landmark@ along@ this@ road@ 
1875,its significance lies@ in@ its double@ message@ that the aim@ of@ the palestinian struggle@ is the establishment of@ palestinian independence and that this@ independence is regarded@ as being not at@ israel's expense@ 
1876,this@ has been a constant theme of@ intifada policy that we wish to build@ palestine not to destroy@ israel that we wish to achieve freedom@ for@ our people not to deprive others israelis of@ it@ that we wish to protect and save lives ours not to endanger the lives of@ others israelis
1877,in@ one of several intifada leaflets written in@ hebrew and addressed@ to@ the israeli soldiers on@ duty in the occupied territories the message@ was repeated soldier go home 
1878,return to your family and children
1879,be with them in@ peace so that we may remain with our family and children in@ peace
1880,we do not wish to harm@ you or your state
1881,we wish to be unharmed@ in@ our own state
1882,how can the process of@ state building@ be developed 
1883,if the pnc declaration of independence constituted a major landmark@ in@ this@ process the time has come@ to embark@ on@ another major step@ that@ of@ declaring@ the setting@ up@ of@ a state or government structure@ 
1884,an escalation of@ the intifada in@ this@ direction@ would serve@ two purposes at once
1885,first it would consolidate@ the structures@ of@ the developing@ national authority which is competing@ to replace@ the occupation authority
1886,second it would consolidate@ the image@ and essence@ of@ the intifada as a constructive not a destructive force@ 
1887,naturally to embark@ on@ such a step@ is not necessarily to succeed immediately@ in@ realising it@ 
1888,rather it is a challenge@ 
1889,it will be a further challenge@ to@ israel's occupation conceived@ in@ the image@ of@ earlier challenges@ of@ the intifada
1890,but it will also be a challenge@ to@ us palestinians summoning@ us to work more energetically towards@ the idea's fulfilment
1891,it would be a natural@ extension@ of@ the intifada's dual strategy@ towards@ disengagement@ from@ israel and the corresponding process of@ state building@ 
1892,it would further@ naturalise@ and legitimise the evolving@ skeletal@ form@ of@ palestinian independence
1893,it would provide the multitudinous popular committees and activities with@ a more advanced form@ of@ organisation and structure@ 
1894,it would enable better planning and performance
1895,it would maximise@ civilian tactics@ of@ resistance@ and defuse@ the natural@ potential for@ violence containing@ and eventually eliminating the marginal@ but intrusive phenomenon of@ collaborator activation by israeli security authorities and collaborator execution by local palestinians
1896,it would create a further fact that would put@ israel on@ the spot@ 
1897,israel's reaction@ however hostile@ could only further our cause
1898,arresting or deporting the tens of thousands of palestinian professionals who would be employed in@ perfectly apolitical harmless@ and humanitarian jobs can only further@ isolate@ the israeli government
1899,half-way@ measures@ can only imply@ half-way@ success
1900,a modus vivendi would also imply@ success
1901,in general our policy should be to proceed@ with@ building@ our state block@ by@ block@ without@ waiting to be given@ a gift@ of@ it through@ negotiations
1902,we should regard@ negotiations rather as the means@ by which we could establish formal@ agreements between@ our state and israel
1903,such agreements can range@ from@ the issue of@ borders@ to@ the issue of@ free@ wave-lengths for@ our future television and radio networks
1904,in@ the meantime we have@ the capacity@ to bring@ coherence and organisation to@ a whole@ range@ of@ activities further@ consolidating the institutional linkage@ between@ the people in the occupied state and the plo leadership

1906,a pyramid@ administrative structure@ establishing links@ from@ popular committees in villages right up to@ the executive committee of@ the plo in@ its capacity@ as a cabinet can be established

1932,i feel@ appalled bythe way@ these@ professional guardians have treatedus
1933,if you were a gambling@ man it would not affect you it would just be lost@ 
1934,but this@ was not a gamble@ 
1935,like so many investors mr tyson found@ himself having to go back to@ work to ease@ the financial strain@ he had hoped to avoid@ 
1936,ironically it was the government which he partly blamed for the affair that gave@ him the chance to return@ to@ work after@ retirement
1937,a change in@ the tax rules affecting pensions was shortly followed@ bya job with@ the department of environment's property services agency a post which carries him through to@ march and may see@ him stay@ until he is #
1938,putting@ it as politely as he can mr tyson said the whole@ affair encouraged@ him to return@ to@ paid employment
1939,i hadn't planned@ to work at all
1940,and like all of the other investors he and his wife were in@ a quandry
1941,they wanted to do something but felt@ powerless
1942,pursuing@ legal action would have cost them money they didn't have unless it meant@ selling their house which was not an option but doing nothing left@ them with@ the feeling@ that justice wasn't being done
1943,so they compromised and gave # to@ the barlow clowes investors groupwhich was formed@ last july to represent@ the investors' interests and co-ordinate@ the fight@ for compensation
1944,that@ says mr tyson has been their only blessing@ 
1945,they are dedicated people who clearlyknow what they are talking@ about@ and have guided@ us through@ it
1946,those@ people are victims@ too but they have certainly kept@ us together@ 
1947,that@ aside@ the last year has brought@ littlerespite from@ their own very personal crisis@ 
1948,the tysons have yet to seeany cash payment fromthe liquidators who have been winding@ up@ bci's affairs
1949,what little money has been recovered remains the subject@ of a legal tussle@ in@ the courts which may yet take@ months to resolve
1950,they have been told that their claim may only amount to@ around@ # of their # as capital gains tax is likely to be deducted from@ the total
1951,but until they get any money back the tysons find@ themselves in@ the position@ of the gambler@ who gambled@ all and lost@ 
1952,except that the tysons don't gamble@ 
1953,the boy and the dog skirted round opposite sides of the puddle the boy a light tall fourteen-year-old labouring@ in wellington boots too large for him and the dog a three-year-old labrador bitch picking@ her way reluctantly with@ frequent pauses as if her paws hurt
1954,the boy unlike the dog knew that the mud did not go@ on@ for ever beyond the bridge the disused railway embankment along which they were walking became built up so that water ran@ off it
1955,he pulled the dog close to him to let a mixed string@ of horses and ponies go past waving shyly to@ the lead rider a pretty capable girl an unbridgeable two years older than him
1956,he watched her as she went past at@ a walk the black labrador and he both gazing wistfully their breath steaming in@ the cold february morning
1957,he waited till the horses were well away and looked round the wide flat landscape carefully before unclipping the lead
1958,way you go patty he said softly@ and the dog was off hurling@ herself along the embankment all paws and flying@ ears after a rabbit who had been sitting@ in@ a patch@ of sun but disappeared with@ contemptuous@ ease as she came close
1959,the boy had been told unequivocally not to let her off the lead the riding-school only used@ the land by grace@ of its owner and it was a shooting estate@ but he hated keeping the dog straining at the lead and knew that she would always come to@ his call
1960,he stood for a moment laughing at@ her as she cast@ furiously@ for the vanished rabbit and walked on to catch@ her up@ along the raised embankment
1961,the trees had grown@ up@ beside it in@ the twenty-five years since the railway had closed@ and the boy stopped every now@ and then@ to watch small birds hopping around the top branches
1962,he particularly liked this stretch@ nothing but the odd@ tractor and the horses ever came down@ this embankment and the birds were unworried by his presence 
1963,after@ half a mile he decided to turn off the embankment and walk up@ the side of the next field and along the path at the top of it following the horses whom he could still see in@ the distance
1964,he called patty to@ him
1965,she didn't come which was surprising she was a docile creature and particularly devoted to@ him because he always took her for a walk when he was at the stables
1966,he could hear her barking and looked down over the steep side of the embankment to the bottom of the trees
1967,he called her again and again but she would not stop barking at@ something he could not see
1968,probably a squirrel he decided and slithered@ down the side of the embankment to join@ her scolding as he went
1969,straightening up beside the dog he looked where she was looking and blinked
1970,he saw a leg uncomfortably wedged between sapling trees swollen grotesquely and gazed@ at it stupidly wondering if it was plastic
1971,as his eyes focused he realized he was looking at@ a hideously swollen human body and just then as the light@ breeze shifted@ he caught@ the stomach-turning@ odour of decay
1972,he was a sensible and capable boy an eldest child so he moved closer trying not to breathe and stood steadfastly looking until he was confident of what he had seen a body must be a girl because it was wearing a skirt lying face down head towards the bottom of the embankment as if she had dived off the top
1973,he clipped the lead on to the dog with cold hands which would hardly function and let her pull him up the slope as fast as he could make@ his legs move
1974,he stopped on the embankment shaking with@ cold and shock to note@ the spot@ then fled along the tractor paths the dog running with him to the stables where the ten o'clock children's ride was in@ its closing@ stages@ 
1975,miss williams
1976,jamie i'm teaching
1977,the thin capable woman who was taking@ the riding-class looked at@ him in@ amazement as he leaned panting on the gate to the ring the dog whining@ beside him
1978,i'm sorry
1979,please i've found something i must tell you 
1980,she had known him since he was a very small five-year-old perched@ a mosquito@ on one of the placid beginners' ponies so she told the class to carry on walking their ponies while she came to him
1981,there's someone dead
1982,below the railway embankment
1983,are you sure
1984,the boy looked at@ her and uncontrollable tears suddenly filled@ his eyes
1985,he was very nearly as tall as her but she put an arm under his shoulders and supported him to the untidy room which served@ as the stable office calling to@ one of the stable girls to take over the class
1986,patty found her
1987,she's just lying there but she is dead
1988,he scrubbed at his face with the handkerchief she offered and gulped@ for air
1989,i'll ring the police
1990,she did so casting@ an experienced eye over@ him
1991,sit down here jamie and i'll make some tea
1992,mummy will come back in@ a few minutes won't she for susie
1993,not mummy
1994,aunt margaret is coming at@ ten
1995,the boy thought longingly of his mother but managed to help miss williams describe the location of the body to@ a startled local station sergeant@ and to drink a cup of sweet milky tea without@ being sick
1996,by@ the time his aunt arrived jamie was so far@ recovered as to be able to refuse to go home and to point@ out@ severely that he would be needed either to assist the police or to be lead rider in@ the eleven-thirty class or possibly both
1997,he watched his aunt and miss williams wordlessly consult each other but knew his aunt would do as she was told successful solicitor@ though she was she was ten years younger than miss williams and as she complained totally intimidated by her as she had not been by anyone since her late headmistress
1998,he was unsurprised to find her packed off firmly@ to take his sister home leaving him as a person of major importance in@ what he instantly assumed@ to be a real murder
1999,miss williams took him to meet the police land rover at the stable gate a bone-thin wiry@ woman in@ her late fifties her expression sufficiently forbidding to prevent the parents edging@ cars through the gate to collect@ children from@ the ten o'clock ride from@ asking any questions
2000,jamie through@ a renewed queasiness@ just observed that the police driver was instantly reduced to@ half@ his age by miss williams's greeting
2001,he was one of my boys she said in@ explanation to@ the cid sergeant@ who was leading@ the party as they bumped over the rough road through the thick mud and on to the dry embankment
2002,like jamie here
2003,did you recognize the person you found young man the sergeant@ asked carefully
2004,no
2005,tears started into jamie's eyes
2006,she was all swollen
2007,the sergeant@'s eyes widened and he slid out of the land rover and stood back to let jamie out
2008,very competent boy
2009,almost a professional singer handles@ himself very well
2010,miss williams's natural pitch well suited to@ reaching@ across a hunting-field was discreetly reduced@ 
2011,the cid sergeant@ thanked her gravely and went to stand beside jamie who was peering down the embankment looking pinched
2012,we'll go down together lad
2013,there isn't room
2014,i'll lead
2015,he took@ a deep@ breath and headed down the sergeant@ two constables and miss williams in@ his wake@ 
2016,soon they all stood side by side one of the younger policemen coughing involuntarily
2017,oh dear oh dear miss williams said on@ an indrawn breath
2018,sorry
2019,come along jamie let's get you back
2020,she took out a handkerchief and mopped@ her eyes
2021,the police driver shot@ jamie a look of enquiry which he missed@ occupied@ as he was with@ guiding miss williams back@ up the hill
2022,he had seen her weep before but only for a sick horse and he was awe-struck
2023,jamie did you let patty off the lead
2024,the boy blushed to@ his ears and owned to@ it
2025,you must not do it jamie we'll be in@ trouble with@ colonel james i've told all you boys a thousand times
2026,he'll perhaps not do it again the sergeant@ murmured and received the look that miss williams habitually bent@ on@ a child who was riding carelessly
2027,how long@ had she been there
2028,jamie asked anxiously 
2029,a few days the sergeant@ said grimly
2030,how many
2031,doctor'll tell us
2032,he considered the boy thoughtfully and decided to take him back@ quickly
2033,these teenagers were in@ his experience a lot less tough@ than they looked
2034,any idea who it could be he asked miss williams casually
2035,no
2036,but only a local would know to put a body there
2037,if jamie hadn't let the dog off the lead she could have been there much longer
2038,the sergeant@ nodded deciding it could do@ no harm to concede@ a point@ he had already taken@ 
2039,no one could tell@ who she was surely
2040,miss williams said quietly to@ him sounding shaky
2041,she didn't even look 
2042,the sergeant@ confirmed@ that that happened with@ bodies after@ a few days
2043,we'll identify her though he said reassuringly
2044,somebody will likely have reported her missing
2045,he stopped abruptly as he remembered a conversation earlier that@ week and lit@ a cigarette thinking furiously@ 
2046,this could be the girl whom the yard were looking for and he had better do everything very quickly indeed including@ finding his chief who would then want to find chief constable and notify scotland yard
2047,presumably it would be the yard who investigated this@ one rather than the regional crime squad@ 
2048,he chewed his thumbnail as he walked out of long@ experience keeping@ in@ mind the highest@ priorities ensure body not moved and ensure next@ of kin notified before the press got@ the story
2049,he posted the detective constable he had@ with him back@ down@ the path to join@ his colleague armed@ with@ instructions to repel@ all attempts by anyone however senior@ or armed@ with@ whatever authority to go anywhere near the body unless he sergeant@ black personally accompanied them
2050,then he climbed into the land rover beside his two passengers and drove off fast with@ the aim@ of abandoning jamie to@ the custody of his aunt as quickly@ as possible
2051,he could see with half@ an eye that the kid's aunt was going to be one of the confident bossy well-connected@ women with whom that part of cambridgeshire was substantially@ over-@ 
2052,john mcleish was in his office saturday or no saturday telling himself he needed to catch@ up@ on@ the paperwork
2053,the phone rang and he picked it up frowning
2054,one of the pleasures of saturday working was that the phone did not ring all the time
2055,the voice at the other end was plainly over-excited and it took@ him a minute to disentangle@ what he was being told
2056,oh congratulations charlie
2057,sorry what did you say it was again
2058,a little girl
2059,actually a very big girl as these@ things@ go@ nine pounds
2060,it's fantastic@ john there she is a new person lying on her face sound asleep
2061,i've just left them and i'm going back 
2062,mcleish repressed the malicious thought that this@ event might putfrancesca's nose@ just a little bit out of joint@ 
2063,she had been utterly secure in@ her position@ as the only girl in@ the wilson family and now there was another one
2064,i've got another bit@ of good news
2065,frannie's going to be able to bring tristram home pretty soon apparently
2066,mcleish expressed qualified@ enthusiasm and charlie assured him he felt@ exactly the same about@ his younger brother
2067,the difficulty is that perry does everything that@ bit@ better than tristram
2068,not that this@ is any excuse john i know
2069,he paused mcleish irresistibly@ of a labrador@ wondering@ how best to approach@ an acquaintance@ 
2070,i wanted to say you see@ that i know you thought frannie shouldn't have gone and that it's ruined your holiday plans@ and on behalf of us all i'm sorry
2071,i know the little boys lean@ on@ her too much and would have gone if i could
2072,he coughed embarrassed and a little pompous very much conscious of his new status as a father while mcleish remembered that he was a scant four years older than the delinquent tristram
2073,anyway she should be back@ soon charlie concluded
2074,mcleish thanked him gravely feeling@ as he often did with@ the wilsons that he was being enveloped@ in@ a large feather eiderdown@ and made@ restless by the call@ went down@ the corridor to where he knew catherine crane was also in getting@ her office in@ order@ 
2075,he stopped at the door and smiled at@ her
2076,wearing jeans and a blue shirt she was tugging at@ a filing cabinet which was too large for her to embrace@ and which was threatening@ to over-balance@ on her
2077,she looked about@ sixteen and beautiful
2078,she let@ go@ of the cabinet coughing in the dust of ages that appeared@ to be lurking@ behind it and smiled back@ at@ him as the february sun shone through the small window behind her throwing@ into@ sharp@ relief@ the patches@ on the wall where her predecessor had hung posters and the ingrained dirt on the flaking paintwork round the mean@ narrow metal window
2079,where do you want that put
2080,mcleish advanced on@ the cabinet and shifted it authoritatively ignoring the clip@ on@ the ankle@ dealt him by an unsecured bottom drawer apparently full of bricks 
2081,i should have unloaded it first catherine crane said apologetically but i just couldn't move in@ any direction with it where it was
2082,i'm here just tell me if you want anything else shifted
2083,he hesitated
2084,i'm going todo@ another hour then have@ some lunch if you want to come
2085,he was aware that he was not managing@ to sound exactly like a senior officer making a recent arrival feel@ at@ home@ but decided not to add@ any further@ riders@ to@ his invitation
2086,that@ would be very nice
2087,are we going to the canteen
2088,not if i can help it
2089,what about@ the pub
2090,if i'm allowed to buy my own
2091,mcleish considered
2092,that@'s fine on@ the food i'll buy the drinks i'm too old to get used to women buying my drinks
2093,she laughed at@ him and said gravely that she would be happy to indulge him and he went away grinning
2094,peter yeo was also in his office having told his wife he was lunching with a client
2095,it was he felt@ just too difficult to be at home at all with@ claudia in@ a permanently bitchy mood and both his teenage children taking@ their cue@ from@ her and behaving intolerably
2096,he wandered restlessly about and decided that the lie might as well become@ the truth
2097,without angela morgan at least two major clients were in@ danger of not getting@ the assiduous@ service they were paying for and it would be well@ worth@ trying to see@ if one of them whom he knew to be a fellow refugee@ from@ family life at@ the weekends could be found
2098,he was in@ luck and fixed@ to meet andy barton at brazzo's where yeo davis had@ a table permanently booked@ 
2099,he had to admit@ that this@ particular client hardly added@ to@ the general decorative smartness@ of the place
2100,andy barton founder and chief executive of barton textiles was almost as broad as he was long virtually neckless with incongruously long brown hair curling over his collar
2101,his enormous hands dwarfed the elegant menu which he was studying in@ apparent disbelief and peter yeo noticed again as barton without@ rising extended one massive paw@ that though the fingers were an ordinary length it was the width of the palms that made@ the hands so large
2102,i never see@ how they get@ the sales per square foot@ in these@ places barton observed@ without@ further greeting
2103,i mean they're not open@ twelve hours like my shops and they aren't using@ the space
2104,his small bright@ blue eyes swept@ disparagingly over@ the minimalized black and white flooring stainless steel chairs and black wooden bar
2105,they make@ a huge@ margin@ on@ a smaller@ turnover@ andy out of@ punters@ like us
2106,peter yeo was amused by and respectful of a man with@ an obsession
2107,angela not working today
2108,barton worked a sixteen-hour day which began@ with@ careful@ detailed consideration of the trading figures and key ratios@ for every one of his forty-three major shops and the output@ of both factories and continued usually by helicopter with@ a detailed aerial survey of a particular area as the quick@ way@ of identifying@ new sites interspersed@ with@ unheralded descents@ on@ the manager of any shop he took@ a fancy@ to visit
2109,peter yeo who had known this@ particular juggernaut@ since he had his first small factory and two stores@ and dirt under his fingernails from@ shifting packing-cases personally was not fazed by the question
2110,angela's taking@ a few days off@ she hasn't been well he said easily@ 
2111,i know she's been working very hard@ for you
2112,i'm up@ to@ speed@ with@ huerter of course but is your planning@ application@ in leicester all right
2113,barton assured him warmly@ that angela had done a great@ job@ and he was now@ confident of getting@ planning@ permission on@ the vast site he had wanted
2114,peter yeo who knew him in@ this@ over-@ over-@ mood decided to prod@ gently
2115,angela said the council wanted it for@ housing
2116,yeah some of them did
2117,silly buggers it's jobs they want there@ first
2118,plenty of housing if those@ stupid farts@ at@ the council got round to repairing it and stopped@ their tenants tearing apart what they have got
2119,my mum brought up five of us in a flat far@ worse than what these@ immigrants complain about@ 
2120,peter yeo who had personally persuaded barton of the presentational@ disadvantage of using words like darkies niggers or wogs decided that immigrants even though used in@ the manner of one invoking@ a curse@ was as good as he was going to get@ with@ this@ particular client
2121,she's doing a good job@ on@ sorting@ this@ huerter thing@ too
2122,bloody@ ridiculous them blokes at@ the dti pushing@ assistance for huerter
2123,i voted for this@ government because they said they weren't going to go in for that@ sort of rubbish@ 
2124,no one ever gave me anything and my business works@ 
2125,still angie can fix@ the treasury on@ this@ one given her boyfriend can't she
2126,that@'s the reason i wanted you on@ this@ 
2127,peter yeo winced@ inwardly but he was not going to tell andy barton that angela was missing or express@ any of his reservations@ about@ how much influence@ angela could bring@ to bear@ 
2128,he smoothly@ changed@ the subject@ to@ the looks@ of the blond model@ three tables away and barton agreed he wouldn't mind a bit@ of that@ on@ the thin@ side@ mind@ you@ but tasty@ 
2129,the rest@ of lunch passed@ in@ similar diversion@ interspersed@ with@ details of last week's turnover@ which were never far@ from@ barton's mind whatever other distractions@ offered@ 
2130,mrs huntley was having@ lunch with her daughter
2131,she ate placidly acknowledging to@ herself with@ her customary good sense@ that at@ the moment as at@ any time since her brother william had died she and penelope were getting@ no pleasure at all from@ each other's company
2132,penelope was looking particularly discontented and disaffected@ picking at her food
2133,her red suit was smart@ but too bright@ a colour for her pale english pink and white skin her brown hair could have done@ with@ a wash and her nails were ragged and bitten
2134,she was frowning deep lines@ appearing@ between her eyebrows mouth drawn@ down at the edges so that instead of a classically good-looking slim english rose@ in@ her late twenties she looked faded@ years older than her real age and shrewish
2135,mrs huntley sighed her brother whom she had loved but knew to be self-indulgent to@ a fault@ had done@ his niece real harm@ by leaving@ so much of his money away from@ the girl who had confidently believed herself to be his favourite thing@ on earth
2136,penelope however it had to be acknowledged had made@ no attempt to rise@ above@ the blow@ she had been dealt@ by finding a dazzling@ girl of her own age favoured over@ herself in@ her uncle's will@ 
2137,at least mrs huntley thought hopefully she had stopped@ wondering unbecomingly@ and stridently@ how her uncle could have been fooled@ by angela morgan
2138,it was grizel huntley's own view@ that her brother had not been fooled@ at all but had been charmed@ and diverted@ by a dashing girl thirty years his junior and had seen@ no reason at all why she should not have@ a share@ of his considerable@ estate@ when that@ left@ a very decent@ down-setting@ for his niece as well
2139,indeed she had respected angela morgan for the straightforwardness@ with@ which she had tackled@ the issue when they had met at the lawyer's office
2140,i'm sorry you're disappointed she had said to@ penelope but after@ all there's a lot@ of money quite enough for both of us
2141,so there was grizel huntley acknowledged and it would be a great deal better if penny could manage@ to think a bit more positively
2142,if she has vanished i'm going to see@ that@ solicitor about@ whether i can get@ her presumed dead
2143,penny sounding childishly sullenly determined@ broke@ into@ her mother's thoughts
2144,grizel huntley looked across@ at@ her shocked@ 
2145,i would wait a little if i were you
2146,penelope glared@ at@ her turning an ungraceful@ scarlet but mrs huntley held@ her ground@ 
2147,you are being silly about@ this@ penny
2148,you are letting@ this@ disappointment and that@'s all it is you're still a very well-off young woman get@ in@ the way@ of everything
2149,penelope choked on@ her pudding and started to cry angry@ uncontrollable tears
2150,grizel huntley reached out to comfort@ her but she forced back@ her chair and fled@ clutching her handbag and napkin leaving her mother with the ruins@ of lunch
2151,fifty miles north sarah morgan had just finished serving a lunch that no one had done more than pick at
2152,her husband francis had made a slightly better showing@ than her daughter jennifer who was looking particularly ragged@ 
2153,mother and daughter were very like each other tall dark@ slim pleasant-looking women with mid-brown curly hair and slightly snub noses
2154,francis morgan by contrast@ was dark almost black-haired sallow-skinned with bright@ brown eyes
2155,of medium height and packed@ with@ energy even distressed as he was he was bursting@ round@ the kitchen hair still damp at the back from@ his swim
2156,let's go to the flicks
2157,no point@ at all sitting round looking at@ each other
2158,come@ on@ jennifer or are you going out with michael
2159,he's gone back to australia dad
2160,last week
2161,jennifer sounded defeated@ and he looked at@ her sideways with@ familiar love and exasperation
2162,she just didn't seem to be able to hang on tomen he thought impatiently not like his angie wherever she was
2163,giles rang up his daughter volunteered@ and he was uncomfortably@ reminded by something in@ her voice that giles hawick was one of the men jennifer hadn't been able to hang on to or not once he had seen angela
2164,how was he his wife sarah asked rather too quickly
2165,well@ very worried
2166,he said the police were talking to@ everyone angie had seen in@ the two weeks before@ she well vanished and so far@ had come up with nothing
2167,i mean no one noticed anything unusual about@ her and she seemed to be full@ of plans@ for the wedding
2168,well@ i told them that@ francis morgan said irritably and his wife and daughter caught@ each other's eye@ in@ silent agreement that he hadn't told them that angela was refusing point-black@ to be married from@ home and was insisting on@ the full@ london set-out@ reception@ at the house of commons replying unanswerably when he had objected on@ grounds@ of expense that she could well afford to pay for it herself
2169,a row of epic@ proportions@ had ensued which he and angela had evidently enjoyed but which had left@ sarah and jennifer sick@ with@ distress
2170,i don't want to go out frank
2171,someone might ring@ 
2172,sarah morgan was sounding diffident but resolute and as morgan opened his mouth to protest in@ exasperation the doorbell rang
2173,both women looked at@ him in@ joint appeal@ and he marched@ to the door pulling it open with@ unnecessary force
2174,he stood door in hand checked@ by something in@ the way@ his visitors a man and a woman were standing
2175,the man a stocky greying fifty-year-old in a navy raincoat over a suit his hair cut short was attended by a uniformed policewoman hair smartly@ set under the cap her eyes watchful@ in the wide flat placid face and both of them were standing square@ and stolid@ 
2176,francis morgan stood and stared at@ them and even before@ the man stepped forward steadily hand extended mouth opening to speak he understood who they were and what they had come to tell him 
2177,mark sanders returned from istanbul feeling@ exhausted@ depressed and ill
2178,the blinding@ headaches he had been experiencing in@ recent weeks were taking@ their toll@ and he looked grey@ and drawn when he arrived home
2179,lately georgina had been worried bythe general deterioration in@ his appearance
2180,but now she was visibly shocked@ by the drained and haggard-looking face which kissed@ her
2181,she wanted to say you look awful darling but decided against@ it
2182,what kind of a trip have you had@ she asked instead
2183,oh not too bad he replied wearily
2184,she took his suitcase and placed it at the bottom of the stairs
2185,come into the kitchen and we will have@ a cup of tea
2186,i've@ so much news to tell you
2187,all sorts of things@ seem to have happened while you have been away this@ time
2188,mark smiled thinly@ and kissed her affectionately on the cheek
2189,tell me about@ it he replied
2190,i could do with@ a good laugh
2191,why darling
2192,what's the matter
2193,trouble at t'mill
2194,mark slipped an arm around her slim waist as they walked from the hall into the kitchen
2195,perhaps it's old montezuma's revenge he replied
2196,must be getting@ too old for this@ globe-trotting lark@ or else my mis-spent@ youth is catching@ up@ on@ me
2197,i'm rapidly coming@ to@ the conclusion that this@ is a young man's game@ 
2198,nonsense mark
2199,you're still a young man well youngish she said trying to tease@ him out of@ his apparent lethargy and depression@ 
2200,let's have@ that@ cup of tea and you'll feel@ better
2201,ah fill the cup what boots@ it to repeat how time is slipping@ underneath our feet he quoted with@ a sigh 
2202,oh darling
2203,what a sad@ sack@ we are today
2204,is that@ how you feel@ 
2205,shall i accompany@ you on@ the violin
2206,now let me tell you all the news
2207,she poured the tea
2208,christopher has been promoted after@ only one year
2209,the chairman of the company told him he was most impressed with@ the contribution@ he's made@ to@ the business and that he could go@ right to@ the top@ if he keeps@ it up@ 
2210,i knew you'd be delighted to hear that@ 
2211,she sipped her tea
2212,next
2213,i've found a super husband for harriet
2214,champion@ of the breed at@ crufts last year
2215,lives in the next village believe it or not
2216,absolutely magnificent dog
2217,lucky harriet said mark
2218,what else
2219,ah yes a secretary at@ the ministry of industry wants you to ring him
2220,seems they want you to address@ the european commission on@ european industrial development 
2221,in dublin i think she said
2222,something about@ the factors which influence multi-nat location decisions
2223,anyway you'll know what it means@ when you see it
2224,i've written it all down@ 
2225,oh and yes a chap from@ conservative central@ office rang up to say they'd like to know if you would be prepared@ to stand@ for the european parliament
2226,he sounded somewhat to@ the right@ of genghis khan
2227,i said i didn't think so as you were rather busy but i'd pass@ the message on@ 
2228,hope i did the right thing@ 
2229,i said you never knew where you were from@ one week to@ the next
2230,he said that@ would do nicely
2231,just like the american express advertisement
2232,perfect credentials apparently for european parliamentarians
2233,now what next
2234,the chicheley-smythes have bought an absolutely super villa in sardinia and say we could rent it if we'd like to
2235,i've seen the photographs
2236,gorgeous location overlooking@ a quiet@ bay
2237,it sleeps ten with a permanent staff of three
2238,only a thousand pounds a week yacht included@ 
2239,i'd love that@ for two or three weeks wouldn't you
2240,we wouldn't want to stint ourselves mark said facetiously four or five i should think
2241,and we could take the family she said
2242,we haven't had@ a family holiday for years
2243,i'd like that@ 
2244,but we can talk about@ that@ later
2245,and i've decided to take@ up@ riding again
2246,don't ask me why
2247,just got@ the urge that@'s all 
2248,she gave@ him a beautiful smile which lit@ her lovely face
2249,well how's that@ for starters@ she asked
2250,he had heard that@ expression before@ 
2251,is there more
2252,now let me see@ 
2253,ah yes
2254,andrew's coming home for the weekend so i thought it would be nice to have@ a drinks party
2255,i've invited the bunkers if that@'s all right
2256,i like clem and gwen and the girls would be nicer company for andrew
2257,fine agreed mark without@ much enthusiasm
2258,if clem can make@ it@ that is
2259,i heard about@ this@ latest merseyside strike@ in istanbul
2260,could finish@ off@ the uk vehicle division he said forlornly and don peters he added@ shaking his head
2261,some of the stupid bastards won't be satisfied until we no longer make a single vehicle in the uk
2262,then i suppose they'll say it's all management's fault and people will believe them
2263,and who the hell is management he demanded his voice rising@ 
2264,people like me who've worked their guts@ out@ to expand@ the business while the militant bastards@ have been working their guts@ out@ to destroy@ it
2265,georgina was nodding agreement
2266,she patted his wrist
2267,i'm quite sure you're right dear
2268,but we weren't talking about@ the motor industry and the never-ending management-union saga@ 
2269,we were talking about@ andrew coming home for the weekend and having@ the bunkers round@ for drinks
2270,and i do wish you wouldn't swear like that@ when you talk about@ business 
2271,you never used to swear you know
2272,at least you didn't when you were with me
2273,but you do now darling and i do wish you wouldn't
2274,you are becoming so hard@ and bitter@ and it's not really like you
2275,mark sighed
2276,i'm sorry
2277,it's just
2278,it's just that there really is trouble at t'mill she said quietly
2279,that@'s it isn't it
2280,you weren't going to tell me
2281,you were just going to worry about@ it alone
2282,you let me go@ rabitting on@ 
2283,he hugged her kissed her cheek
2284,i'm not sure yet that there really is something to worry about@ 
2285,but you think there is
2286,he nodded
2287,i have@ a horrible feeling that um is about@ to reorganise world-wide planning@ operations@ and if that@ happens it's curtains@ for the european organisation and for me
2288,curtains she said
2289,what exactly would that@ mean@ 
2290,early retirement
2291,mark you're not serious
2292,i think it could be on@ the cards@ 
2293,they could transfer me to detroit or somewhere
2294,i don't know but i don't like the signs@ 
2295,oh mark she said
2296,they wouldn't do that to@ you
2297,they just couldn't
2298,not after@ all you've done for the corporation
2299,they couldn't be that unfair and ruthless
2300,his expression was wry
2301,my dear they'll do whatever they feel@ is necessary to do
2302,sentiment loyalty service and track@ record none of these@ things@ will come@ into@ it
2303,georgina took him in her arms and kissed him on the lips
2304,it's all so ridiculous that we're not going to even think about@ it any more she said firmly@ hiding@ her fears
2305,now come into the garden she added@ smiling
2306,i want to show you the clematis
2307,it's a mass@ of colour
2308,lying in bed that@ evening they talked a lot about@ their life together
2309,they recalled@ their first days
2310,the county ball
2311,the paul jones and the emotional somersaults@ when the music stopped@ and they came@ face to face for the very first time
2312,the wedding
2313,the birth of their first son adam and then christopher and andrew
2314,the children growing up with@ all the laughter and tears
2315,schooldays and the void@ they both felt@ when the boys went off to boarding school followed by the joy unconfined@ when they came home at@ the end@ of term
2316,mark's promotions and progress up@ the company ladder@ 
2317,new and changing homes
2318,friends lost and friends gained@ 
2319,family achievements and disappointments
2320,notwithstanding current problems which they discussed lightly@ it had all been wonderful
2321,they fell@ asleep in@ the early hours of the morning holding hands 
2322,the next day mark arrived back@ at um's european headquarters@ in london and received an early call from@ muldoon
2323,he went down@ the airless corridor to his boss's office said hello to@ the secretary and walked into the large oak-panelled room which was as big as the lobby of many a sizeable hotel
2324,muldoon rose immediately from his enormous black leather chair to greet him coming from behind the vast desk with hand outstretched
2325,hello mark
2326,have@ a good trip
2327,he took the englishman by the arm and ushered him toward the easy chairs arranged around a long rectangular coffee table
2328,instinctively mark felt@ uneasy
2329,why the hand on the arm and the over-@ approach@ 
2330,muldoon never emerged from behind his desk to greet colleagues
2331,only visitors and vips got@ that@ special reception@ 
2332,muldoon poured the coffee
2333,how did the planning@ meeting go@ 
2334,mark asked him
2335,what was nate's reaction@ 
2336,did he and the committee go along with my proposals he added@ 
2337,it went@ fine muldoon said
2338,he seemed somewhat uneasy
2339,klepner did a good job@ 
2340,how did he handle@ the questions
2341,mark asked
2342,he doesn't have@ the inside@ knowledge to deal@ with@ questions
2343,oh ok really
2344,i handled@ some and so did mueller
2345,but klepner did ok
2346,he didn't let@ the side@ down@ 
2347,mark nodded
2348,what was mueller doing answering questions
2349,he was there to ask them
2350,he doesn't know the inside@ track@ any more than klepner
2351,maybe not but he soon will muldoon replied quietly
2352,and what does that@ mean@ 
2353,muldoon seemed to be taking@ a long@ time over@ his coffee
2354,he evaded@ mark's eyes
2355,he's goin' to head-up@ world planning@ operations from detroit
2356,he's already co-ordinating@ the regional plans@ to provide a world picture@ 
2357,so what's changed
2358,deep@ down@ he knew
2359,he's not going to just co-ordinate@ and consolidate any longer muldoon said with increasing@ nervousness
2360,he's gonna plan@ direct@ and control worldwide planning@ operations from detroit including@ the regional planning@ functions
2361,mark's expression was one of faked@ incredulity
2362,his gut@ feelings had been right
2363,you've got to be joking he scoffed
2364,i know that@'s what mueller's always wanted but nate and the executive committee would never fall@ for that@ bloody@ empire-building game@ 
2365,the regions are far@ too big and complex to be handled@ from detroit and even if they were foolish enough to believe that they could do it more effectively which they can't they would be crazy to try
2366,i know mark i know muldoon said
2367,but that@'s what they're gonna do
2368,it will boomerang the englishman said heatedly@ 
2369,overseas governments and local nationals just won't stand@ for it particularly when they get@ to know@ what's going@ on@ 
2370,that@'s one corporate@ plan@ that can't win@ not in@ the long@ term
2371,i know mark
2372,but they think they can run@ everything from detroit and that@'s the way@ the organisation is going to be restructured
2373,they are working on@ it right now
2374,we will know the details in@ a few weeks time
2375,couple of months at@ the latest
2376,mark said quietly
2377,and how does that@ affect the european organisation 
2378,the organisation will be wound@ up@ 
2379,i'm taking@ early retirement
2380,and me
2381,muldoon shrugged
2382,not certain yet
2383,but my guess is early retirement too unless you're prepared@ to go back to@ divisional work
2384,local md perhaps
2385,the englishman snorted
2386,you know i can't go back 
2387,who the hell can
2388,in@ any case you know as well as i do that the mds are always american
2389,well there won't be any european job functions that@'s for sure muldoon said
2390,there'll be a direct@ link@ between@ detroit and the line managers in each country with@ detroit calling@ the shots@ 
2391,don't they realise they're playing@ with@ political dynamite@ 
2392,mark demanded
2393,mueller won't give@ a damn about@ the effect of a corporate@ plan@ on@ europe and on@ individual countries
2394,if he wants to import vehicles or components from taiwan or singapore or hong kong into europe he'll go@ ahead@ and do it regardless of the economic consequences for the european countries concerned
2395,the only thing@ you can be sure of is that us interest will always come@ first
2396,oh and there's one more thing@ you can be sure of he added@ sourly@ 
2397,they won't plan@ to supply the us market@ from@ imports
2398,you can bet your bottom@ dollar on@ that@ 
2399,jesus wept he continued hackles@ rising@ 
2400,mueller will have@ the power@ to make@ or break@ whole areas of europe
2401,he's the last guy in the world who should be given@ such power@ 
2402,the bloody@ man's power@ drunk@ already
2403,he was angry and bitter@ 
2404,i know muldoon agreed sadly
2405,then what are you and clancy doing about@ it
2406,look@ mark muldoon said forlornly what's the point@ 
2407,the wheels@ have already been set@ in@ motion@ 
2408,we're not gonna change@ anyone's mind
2409,you know that@ 
2410,his tone was abject
2411,sorry you're takin@ it so bad he added@ miserably
2412,how else should i take@ it
2413,mark demanded
2414,it's my life which is about@ to go@ down@ the plughole@ 
2415,i'm not an american on@ a brief@ overseas assignment
2416,i've spent@ my entire working life in@ the european components business 
2417,i've grown@ up@ in@ it
2418,it's in my@ blood@ 
2419,i've built plants@ and managed them
2420,designed products and marketed and sold them
2421,when i was an apprentice there were two component plants@ in europe and now there are seventeen and i've had@ a hand@ in@ establishing the last twelve
2422,what the hell do you expectme to say
2423,oh is that@ what they are proposing to do
2424,well bully@ for mueller and the corporation
2425,i'll go@ and collect@ my hat@ and coat@ 
2426,i know how you feel@ mark muldoon said sadly
2427,do you pat
2428,do you
2429,you're sixty-one and have been looking@ forward@ to@ retirement
2430,i'm fifty and have@ a long@ way@ to go
2431,i don't think you can see@ things@ the way@ i see@ them
2432,well perhaps not muldoon agreed
2433,but i can understand how you feel@ 
2434,the englishman nodded and poured himself more coffee
2435,so what's going to happen to@ the european plan@ he asked 
2436,mueller will drive@ it from detroit with@ one or two amendments agreed at@ the epc meeting muldoon told him
2437,what amendments
2438,no further plant@ investment in the uk
2439,i suppose mueller saw@ to@ that@ mark said sarcastically
2440,he really hates our guts@ 
2441,god help the british plants@ under@ the new regime@ 
2442,muldoon shook his head
2443,no it wasn't that@ 
2444,it was the strike@ at merseyside
2445,that@ was the last straw@ as far@ as nate was concerned
2446,up until that@ news hit@ the committee don had won the day with@ his uk vehicle division proposals
2447,but as soon as nate heard about@ the latest strike@ that@ was it
2448,end@ of story@ 
2449,he instructed mueller to phase-out vehicle manufacture in the uk
2450,mark nodded
2451,how did don take@ it
2452,he was beginning to win through
2453,he's very upset
2454,naturally
2455,it's the first time in@ his career he hasn't come@ out@ on@ top@ 
2456,mueller is taking over the plan@ and don is being transferred back@ to the states
2457,public relations job or something similar
2458,just think of it a man of his talent and ability stooging@ around@ the media
2459,so when's he going back to the states
2460,mark said
2461,it won't be announced for a week or so but he's already been told
2462,he'll fly out inside@ the month
2463,and what do you and i do now
2464,mark enquired
2465,start emptying the files
2466,muldoon made@ a face@ 
2467,afraid so
2468,klepner will take over the files and ship them back@ to the states
2469,he'll be mueller's european components planning@ manager in detroit
2470,klepner
2471,mark uttered in@ mock astonishment
2472,the man knows nothing about@ europe
2473,he's a novice@ 
2474,a bloody@ charlatan
2475,i know it sounds crazy mark muldoon said
2476,but there@ it is
2477,we have@ no choice in@ the matter
2478,i was instructed to tell you and i have
2479,new york and detroit will come@ up@ with@ an attractive@ separation@ package@ you can be sure of that@ 
2480,they've already told me you'll get@ the maximum terms@ permitted under@ british law
2481,the corporation wants@ to do the right thing@ by you 
2482,the two men rose from the table together
2483,sure
2484,we have@ no choice in@ the matter said the englishman
2485,there has to be losers as well as winners said the american
2486,i guess we're both losers mark
2487,the englishman returned to his own palatial office and sat with his head in hands
2488,another of his blinding@ headaches had developed and he felt a tight sensation in his chest which made@ breathing very painful and difficult
2489,his secretary entered the room
2490,can i get you a coffee mr sanders
2491,you don't look at all well
2492,shall i get@ the doctor
2493,he looked up and smiled
2494,no thank you millie
2495,i'm all right
2496,just a headache
2497,be ok in@ a minute
2498,would love a cup of coffee though
2499,are you sure i shouldn't get@ a doctor she asked
2500,no thank you
2501,i'll be ok
2502,it's only a headache
2503,millie had@ her reasons for being concerned
2504,the petticoat@ mafia@ at@ the top@ of the organisation always knew@ what was going@ on@ often before@ the top@ executives themselves
2505,millie and the secretaries of pat muldoon and clancy mcgillicuddy were all close@ friends
2506,they had got@ together over@ the weekend to discuss the implications of the confidential letter the two americans had received from randy mueller on behalf of nate cocello
2507,major changes were afoot which affected their respective bosses
2508,by@ the time mark reached@ home that@ evening the pains in his head were excruciating
2509,he decided against@ telling georgina about@ his meeting with muldoon
2510,he would wait for the right moment
2511,this@ wasn't it 
2512,homicide
2513,this@ chapter deals@ with@ the approach@ of the criminal law to@ behaviour which causes or risks@ causing death
2514,murder manslaughter and several other offences are discussed@ and one recurrent issue here@ is whether english law responds@ proportionately@ to@ the different degrees@ of culpability manifested in@ cases where@ death is caused
2515,# death and finality
2516,for practical purposes the culpable@ causing of another person's death may fairly be regarded@ as the most serious@ offence in@ the criminal calendar@ 
2517,there is an argument that treason is a more serious@ offence since it strikes@ at@ the very foundations@ of the state and its social organizations but treason is so rare@ that it is surely permissible to treathomicide as the most serious@ form@ of crime
2518,the reason for this@ is not difficult to find@ the harm caused by many other crimes is remediable to@ a degree@ whereas the harm caused byhomicide is absolutely irremediable
2519,even in@ crimes of violence which leave@ some permanent physical disfigurement or psychological effects the victim retains@ his or her life and therefore the possibility of further pleasures and achievements whereas death is final
2520,this@ finality makes@ it proper to regard@ death as the most serious@ harm that may be inflicted on@ another and to regard@ a person who chooses to inflict that@ harm as the most culpable of offenders in@ the absence of some excuse or justification
2521,although many deaths arise@ from@ natural causes and many others from@ illnesses and diseases each year sees@ a large@ number of deaths caused byaccidents and also a number caused by acts or omissions which amount@ to@ some form@ of homicide in@ english law
2522,for # the statistics show@ that there were some # accidental deaths of which some # occurred in the home # at@ work and # on the roads
2523,by comparison the number of deaths recorded as criminal homicide was # which includes@ all the murders and manslaughters
2524,this@ figureis relatively small@ when compared with@ many american cities but that@ is no cause for satisfaction
2525,there are still awkward questions to be confronted@ 
2526,for example are we satisfied that the # deaths recorded as homicide are in@ fact more culpable@ than all or even most of the deaths recorded as accidents
2527,in@ other words does english criminal law pick@ out@ the most heinous forms@ of killing as murders and manslaughters or are the boundaries@ frozen@ by tradition
2528,another question is whether the criminal law ought not to be wider@ in@ its application@ to@ activities which carry@ some risk of causing death than in@ other spheres@ 
2529,thus even if it would be excessive to sweep@ large@ numbers of the deaths now recorded as accidents into@ the law of homicide there may be sufficient justification for creating@ or enforcing offences designed@ to ensure safe conditions of work safe goods safe buildings and so on
2530,it was argued in@ chapter # that the criminal law ought to spread@ its net@ wider@ where@ the potential harm is greater@ 
2531,it will be seen@ that english law does@ this@ up to@ a point@ and in@ the process seems to accept@ social-defence@ arguments as reasons for departing@ from@ several of the principles set@ out@ in chapter #
2532,# requirements of criminal homicide
2533,english law distinguishes@ between@ the offences of murder and manslaughter as we shall see but the two crimes do have@ certain common elements@ 
2534,it must be proved that the defendant's act or omission caused the death of the victim within@ a year and a day
2535,the requirements of causation in@ the criminal law are discussed@ elsewhere@ 
2536,the year and a day rule@ is a legacy@ of times when medical science was so rudimentary that if there was a substantial@ lapse of time between@ injury and death it was unsafe to pronounce@ on@ whether the defendant's conduct or some other event caused the death
2537,nowadays the problem is quite the reverse@ medical science is generally able@ to determine@ whether d's conduct caused the death and innovations such as life-support@ machines mean that life can be prolonged for months and years in@ some instances
2538,in@ one recent case the victim of a stabbing died two and a half@ years after@ the incident having been kept@ on@ a life-support@ machine for almost the entire time
2539,in@ principle it seems unjust that a homicide conviction should not be possible in@ such a case if all the other elements@ can be established and only the year and a day rule@ stands@ in@ the way@ 
2540,but the rule@ was confirmed by the criminal law revision committee in@ # on@ the ground@ that a defendant should not be left@ in@ peril of a homicide conviction indefinitely
2541,surely prosecutorial discretion should be enough to prevent unfair convictions years after@ the event
2542,the rule@ itself is out@ accord with@ modern medical conditions and should be abolished
2543,defining@ murder the inclusionary question
2544,a the procedural context@ 
2545,if causing death is to be regarded@ as the most serious@ harm that can be inflicted it would seem to follow@ that the most blameworthy form@ of homicide should result in@ the highest@ sentences imposed@ by the courts
2546,indeed many systems@ of criminal law impose@ a mandatory sentence for murder or whatever the highest@ form@ of homicide is called@ in@ that@ system@ 
2547,in@ some jurisdictions this@ is a mandatory sentence of death
2548,in@ others such as those@ in the united kingdom it is the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment
2549,why should this@ penalty be mandatory and not at@ the discretion of the court as in@ other offences
2550,one argument in favour of the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment is that it amounts@ to@ a symbolic indication of the unique heinousness of murder
2551,it places@ the offender under@ the state's control as it were for the remainder of his or her life
2552,this@ is often linked@ with@ a supposed denunciatory effect the idea that the mandatory life sentence denounces@ murder as emphatically as possible and with@ a supposed general deterrent effect in@ declaring@ that there is no mitigation of sentence available for this@ crime
2553,it might also be argued that the mandatory life sentence makes@ a substantial@ contribution@ to public safety
2554,none of these@ arguments is notably strong@ let alone conclusive
2555,the mandatory penalty does indeed serve@ to mark@ out@ murder from@ other crimes but whether the definition of murder is sufficiently refined@ to capture@ the worst killings and only the worst killings remains@ to be discussed@ below@ 
2556,whether the life sentence is regarded@ as a sufficient denunciation in@ society depends on@ the public's perception@ of what life imprisonment means if it is widely believed that it results in@ an average of nine years' imprisonment the effect will be somewhat blunted@ 
2557,the same applies to@ the general deterrent argument its effectiveness depends on@ whether the penalty for murder affects the calculations@ of potential killers at all and if it does whether life imprisonment is seen@ as significantly more or less severe@ than the alternative of a long@ fixed-@ sentence
2558,as for public protection this@ depends on@ executive decisions with regard to release it fails@ to take@ into@ account@ whether it is necessary for public protection to keep lifers in for so long@ 
2559,this@ brings@ the discussion@ to@ a crucial point@ what does the sentence of life imprisonment mean in@ practice and what would be the alternative
2560,what it means is that the time of release from prison is determined by the home@ secretary on@ the advice of the parole board and the lord chief justice rather than by the judge at the trial
2561,in@ procedural terms therefore the life sentence involves a transfer@ of function normally it is the judge who determines the sentence or at least its upper@ limit@ since earlier release on@ parole may be possible whereas a life sentence entrusts@ that@ function to@ the executive who must first ascertain the opinions of the lord chief justice and the trial judge
2562,the home office is not bound@ by those@ opinions and appears to depart@ from@ them frequently
2563,in@ # the home@ secretary imposed restrictions on@ the release of persons serving@ life for murders of policeand prison-officers terrorist killings murder during robbery and the sadistic@ or sexual murder of young children fixing@ a minimum of twenty years' imprisonment for these@ offenders
2564,whatever the justifications for introducing@ this@ policy it serves@ to underline@ the fact that sentencing in@ murder cases is enacted@ without@ each case being considered@ individually@ after@ hearing representations from@ the offender's counsel and without@ a sentence announced in court and subject to appeal
2565,at present the executive takes@ decisions to release some murderers after@ only a few years and to keep others in prison for extremely long@ periods
2566,should those@ decisions not be taken@ by the courts in@ the same way@ as other sentencing decisions
2567,the answer sometimes given@ is that murderers should be treateddifferently because they are particularly dangerous anyone who chooses to kill once can choose to kill again
2568,but this@ argument will seem less persuasive@ when we have discussed@ cases of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility where@ a murder is reduced@ to@ manslaughter the judge has a wide@ sentencing discretion and may according to the facts of the case select a determinate prison sentence a hospital order or life imprisonment
2569,those@ who kill and are convicted of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility are no less dangerous than those@ convicted of murder and yet the judge has@ sentencing discretion in@ one case and not in@ the other
2570,considerations of this@ kind have led@ the houseof lords select committee on@ murder and life imprisonment to recommend the abolition of the mandatory sentence for murder
2571,in@ its place@ would be a sentencing discretion which judges would use in@ many cases to mark@ the relative heinousness of the murder by a determinate prison sentence
2572,in@ cases where@ life imprisonment was thought to be the appropriate sentence the trial judge would still specify in open@ court the number of years to be spent@ in prison taking@ the gravity@ of the offence into@ account@ and release would be determined@ by a judicial tribunal
2573,such a reform would bring@ improvements in@ natural justice without@ loss@ of public protection
2574,b degrees@ of homicide
2575,english criminal law has@ two degrees@ of homicide murder and manslaughter
2576,many american jurisdictions have@ three degrees@ of murder first-degree@ murder requiring premeditation and secondand third-degree@ murder covering@ lesser shades@ of culpability
2577,in england there has been a proposal that we should do away with@ all these@ distinctions leaving@ a single offence of criminal homicide
2578,that@ proposal if implemented would shift@ almost all the decision-making in@ homicide cases from@ the trial to@ the sentencing stage@ the only issue of any consequence in@ most cases would be the sentence to be imposed and all the distinctions now drawn@ at@ the stage@ of criminal liability would be reflected@ in@ the sentence alone
2579,the jury would have@ no role@ in@ most homicide cases since a plea of guilty would be the norm
2580,contrast this@ with@ the position@ in@ jurisdictions where@ there are three or more degrees@ of homicide pleas of guilty to@ firstand second-degree@ murders would be less frequent since there would be the possibility of argument in court if no bargain@ was struck@ beforehand between@ prosecution and defence and the defence might succeed@ in@ persuading the jury to reduce@ the degree@ of the killing
2581,moreover the borderlines@ between@ the various degrees@ would raise@ questions of law which would provide much opportunity for legal argument and for appeals
2582,the result would be that killings were classified and labelled@ in@ a more refined@ way@ but at@ the cost@ of lengthy trials and mounting legal-aid bills@ 
2583,that@ cost@ is not difficult to justify where@ capital@ punishment is the penalty for first-degree@ murder
2584,where@ there is no capital punishment however the question of how many degrees@ of homicide it is desirable to have@ calls@ for careful@ weighing@ of the principle of fair labelling@ see chapter # l against@ the cost@ and time arguments mobilised@ bythe policy of efficient administration see chapter # m
2585,the structure@ of the english law of homicide is rather strange
2586,although there are two offences murder and manslaughter the latter includes@ two distinct@ varieties voluntary manslaughter killings which would be murder but for the existence of defined@ extenuating circumstances and involuntary manslaughter killings for which there is no need to prove any awareness of the risk of death being caused but for which there is thought to be sufficient fault to justify criminal liability
2587,the arguments therefore tend@ to focus@ on@ three borderline questions what is the minimum fault required for conviction of murder
2588,what conditions are needed to reduce@ murder to manslaughter
2589,and what is the minimum fault required for a conviction of manslaughter
2590,c requirements for murder
2591,in@ english criminal law there are now two alternative fault requirements for murder an intent to kill or an intent to cause grievous bodily harm
2592,what do these@ requirements mean
2593,do they extend@ the definition of murder too far@ or are they too narrow@ 
2594,intent to kill may be regarded@ as the most obvious and indisputable form@ of fault element@ for murder but to@ some extent@ that@ depends on@ the meaning of intent
2595,this@ has been the subject@ of a number of houseof lords decisions and yet the definition is still not clear@ and settled@ 
2596,probably the most accurate statement would be that a person to kill if it is his or her purpose to kill bythe act or omission charged@ or if he or she foresees that death is practically certain to follow@ from@ that@ act or omission
2597,in@ this@ way@ both purpose and foresight of practical certainty are regarded@ as part@ of the definition of intent although there are other statements suggesting@ that foresight of practical or virtual certainty is merely evidence from@ which intent may be inferred
2598,how would this@ test be applied@ 
2599,in many cases the word intent is used without@ elaboration but there are some for which a full@ explanation of the meaning of intention is necessary
2600,a fairly typical set@ of facts is provided by # where@ d had@ a grudge against@ a woman and had threatened to burn her out
2601,one night he went to her house poured paraffin through the letter-box and on to the front door and set@ it alight
2602,one of the woman's children died in the ensuing fire
2603,when asked why he did it d replied just to wake her up and frighten her
2604,a defence@ of this@ kind a claim@ that the purpose was only to frighten and not to cause harm requires the full definition to be put@ to@ the jury
2605,the question is granted that d's purpose was to frighten did he nonetheless realize that it was practically certain that his act would cause death or grievous bodily harm to@ someone
2606,the jury should answer this@ bydrawing@ inferences from@ the evidence in@ the case and from@ the surrounding@ circumstances
2607,what about@ the alternative element@ in@ the definition an intent to cause grievous bodily harm
2608,this@ has@ considerable practical importance since this@ is all that the prosecution has to prove in order to obtain a verdict of guilty of murder
2609,it must be shown@ that the defendant intended which again includes@ both purpose and awareness of practical certainty to cause really serious injury to@ someone
2610,the houseof lords confirmed@ this@ rule@ in@ # d struck his victim on the head a number of times with a chair causing injuries from@ which the victim died a week later
2611,d maintained@ throughout@ that he had not intended to kill but there was evidence from@ which the jury could infer and did infer that he intended to cause grievous bodily harm
2612,the houseof lords upheld@ d's conviction for murder an intent to cause really serious@ injury is sufficient for murder without@ any proof that the defendant intended or even contemplated@ the possibility that death would result
2613,does the grievous bodily harm rule@ extend@ the definition of murder too far@ 
2614,if the point@ of distinguishing murder from@ manslaughter is to mark@ out@ the most heinous group of killings for the extra stigma of a murder conviction it can be argued that the grievous bodily harm rule@ draws@ the line@ too low@ 
2615,in terms of principle the rule@ requires justification because it@ departs@ from@ the principle of correspondence see chapter #a namely that the fault element@ in@ a crime should relate to@ the consequences prohibited by that@ crime
2616,byallowing@ an intent to cause grievous bodily harm to suffice for a murder conviction the law is violating@ a general principle turning@ the most serious@ of its offences into@ a constructive@ crime
2617,why should it be necessary to construct@ a murder conviction out of this@ lesser intent
2618,there are arguments in favour of this@ death is final@ murder is the gravest crime and there is no significant@ moral difference between@ someone who chooses to cause really serious injury and someone who sets@ out@ to kill
2619,no one can predict whether a serious injury will result in@ death that@ may depend on@ the victim's physique on@ the speed of an ambulance on@ the distance from the hospital and on@ a range@ of other medical and individual matters
2620,if one person chooses to cause serious@ injury to@ another it should be presumed that he or she realizesthat there is always a risk of death and such cases show@ a sufficiently wanton@ disregard for life as to warrant the label@ murder if death results
2621,the counter-arguments which would uphold@ the principle of correspondence are that breach@ of that@ principle is unnecessary when the amplitude@ of the crime of manslaughter lies@ beneath@ murder and also that the definition of grievous bodily harm includes@ a number of injuries which are most unlikely to put@ the victim's life at@ risk
2622,in@ the leading@ case of lord edmund-davies dissenting gave@ the example of breaking someone's arm that@ is a really serious@ injury but one which is unlikely to endanger the victim's life
2623,so in@ practice the grievous bodily harm rule@ goes@ further@ than the arguments of its protagonists@ would support@ 
2624,would it be right then to confine@ the fault element@ in@ murder to@ an intent to kill
2625,that@ would have@ the merit of simplicity but would it strike@ the right note@ socially
2626,there are powerful@ arguments in favour of saying that there are other killings where@ an intent to kill cannot be established and yet where@ the moral or social culpability is equal to@ that@ in@ most intentional killings
2627,of course one cannot be adamant about@ whether they merit the label@ murder because that@ is a question of drawing@ the line@ between@ murder and manslaughter which is not susceptible of any precise resolution
2628,it is hard@ to argue conclusively that the category of murder should be smaller@ or larger@ unless the death penalty or a mandatory life sentence follows@ it is a question of social judgment
2629,let us briefly consider@ some of the possibilities
2630,the fault element@ for many serious@ offences is intent or recklessness why should this@ not suffice for murder
2631,the question is whether all killings in@ which the defendant is aware of the risk of death are sufficiently serious@ to warrant the term murder
2632,one answer sometimes given@ is that they are not because a driver who overtakes on a bend knowingly taking@ the risk that there is a car travelling in@ the opposite@ direction should not be labelled@ a murderer if a collision and death happen to ensue
2633,this@ example assumes@ that a sympathy for motorists with@ overwhelm@ any tendency to@ logical analysis
2634,one might ask whether motorists are ever justified in@ knowingly taking@ risks with@ other people's lives
2635,yet if the example is modified@ a little so that the overtaking is on a country road at@ night and the risk is known to be slight@ it becomes questionable whether the causing of death in@ these@ circumstances should be labelled@ in@ the same way@ as intentional killings
2636,this@ is not to suggest that motorists should be treateddifferently
2637,the point@ is rather that even though knowingly taking@ risks with@ other people's lives is usually unjustifiable taking@ a slight@ risk is less serious@ than intentionally causing death
2638,in@ discussing@ the boundaries@ of murder we are concerned with@ classification not exculpation
2639,to classify all reckless killings as murder might be too broad@ but the point@ remains@ that some reckless killings may be thought no less heinous than intentional killings
2640,can a satisfactory line@ be drawn@ here@ 
2641,one approach@ would be to draw@ the line@ by reference to@ the degree@ of probability
2642,murder is committed in@ those@ situations@ where@ d caused death byan act or omission which he knew had death as the probable or highly probable result
2643,a version of this@ test of foresight of high@ probability is usedin several other european countries it was introduced@ into@ english law bythe decision in@ 
2644,# but abandoned@ in@ # on@ grounds@ of uncertainty
2645,a second approach@ is to frame@ the law in@ such a way@ as to make@ it clear@ that the court should make@ a moral judgment on@ the gravity of the defendant's conduct
2646,section@ # of the model@ penal code includes@ within@ murder those@ reckless killings which manifest extreme@ indifference to@ the value@ of human life
2647,scots law treats@ as murder killings with@ wicked@ recklessness a phrase which directs@ the court's attention to@ the circumstances of the killing
2648,both the model@ penal code test and the scots test may be reduced@ to@ circularity however for when one asks how extreme@ or how wicked@ the recklessness should be the only possible answer is wicked@ or extreme@ enough to justify the stigma of a murder conviction
2649,admittedly the model@ penal code does contain@ a list of circumstances which may amount@ to@ extreme@ indifference which assists@ the courts and increases@ the predictability of verdicts in@ a way@ that scots law does not but the essence@ of both approaches@ is that there is no precise way@ of describing those@ non-intentional killings which are as heinous as intentional killings
2650,their protagonists@ argue that the law of murder is so important socially that derogation from@ the principle of maximum certainty should be allowed in favour of more accurate labelling@ by the courts opponents@ argue that the principle of maximum certainty is needed here@ specifically to reduce@ the risk of verdicts based on@ discriminatory or irrelevant factors such as distaste for the defendant's background@ allegiance or other activities
2651,a third more precise formulation@ derives@ from@ the recommendations of the criminal law revision committee in@ # namely that a killing should be classified as murder in@ those@ situations@ where@ there is an intention to cause serious@ injury coupled with@ awareness of the risk of death
2652,neither an intention to cause serious injury nor recklessness as to death should be sufficient on@ its own but together they restrict@ one another producing@ a test which both satisfies@ the criterion of certainty and marks@ out@ some heinous but non-intended killings
2653,a fourth approach@ adopted@ by english law@ until@ # and still in@ force@ in@ many american jurisdictions is some form@ of felony-murder rule anyone who kills during the course@ of a felony or more restrictively a serious crime of violence or whilst resisting arrest should be convicted of murder
2654,thus stated there is no reference to@ the defendant's intention or awareness of the risks the fact that d has chosen to commit rape robbery or another serious@ offence and has caused death thereby is held@ to constitute sufficient moral grounds@ for placing@ the killing in@ the highest@ category
2655,plainly this@ is a form@ of constructive@ criminal liability the murder conviction is constructed@ out of the ingredients@ of a lesser offence
2656,presumably the justification is that d has already crossed@ a high@ moral social threshold@ in@ choosing to commit such a serious@ offence and should therefore be held@ liable for whatever consequences ensue however unforeseeable they may be
2657,the objections would be reduced@ if awareness of the risk of death was also required in@ other words if the test were the commission of a serious@ offence of violence plus recklessness as to death
2658,the effect of that@ test would be to pickoutthose@ reckless killings which occurred when d had already manifested substantial@ moral and legal culpability and to classify them as murder
2659,four alternative approaches@ have been described and many others could be listed
2660,the point@ is that the traditional concepts of intention and recklessness do not of themselves appear to be sufficiently well focused@ to mark@ out@ those@ killings which are the most heinous
2661,the law must resort@ to@ some kind of moral and social evaluation of conduct if it is to identify@ and separate@ out@ the most heinous killings
2662,many people might think that a person who causes death whilst using an unlawfully held firearm or explosives ought to be convicted of murder because there is generally speaking no excuse for using such dangerous equipment
2663,some of the people thus covered@ would be armed robbers others would be terrorists
2664,the armed robber might say that he had@ no intention of using the firearm that he carried it with him simply to frighten the victim and that it went off accidentally if the jury believes that@ should he be convicted of murder

2668,debbie adams had to let her east end terrace house in london in@ a hurry when her husband was re-located to ireland with@ two months' notice
2669,she went to a local letting agency landlords of@ # roman road bethnal green london e# who found@ a tenant that@ day
2670,she also employed@ landlords to manage the let
2671,as is common practice landlords kept@ the tenant's deposit@ of@ # and told@ debbie they@ would take@ their entire fee of@ # up front@ so she expected no rent for@ the first month

2716,travel copse and robbers christopher somerville sees@ how woodland has usurped@ the ancient cattle thieves of@ the cheviot hills
2717,by christopher somerville
2718,when a charlton chief sat down to dinner in@ times gone@ by@ and found a spur on the table where his meal should have been he knew the cupboard was bare@ once more
2719,his wife was telling@ him to saddle up and steal a fresh@ batch of cattle from his neighbour's herds
2720,the families of@ north tynedale in westernmost northumberland charltons and robsons milburns and dodds were never slow@ to lay@ hands@ on@ each other's property in@ the lawless@ old@ days
2721,here where the scottish border@ ran@ across the cheviot hills far from civilisation reiving or cattle-thieving was a way@ of@ life
2722,remoteness is still the keynote of@ this@ region but a charlton reiving party would be hard@ put@ to@ it these@ days to work up a good gallop along the upper reaches of the north tyne river
2723,since # the western fringes of the cheviots have been planted with@ # square miles of close-packed@ conifers whilein their depths sprawl@ the seven miles of the kielder water reservoir europe's largest man-made lake
2724,i found@ it hard@ to picture@ what kind of@ landscape those@ statistics might have shaped@ until i opened the ordnance survey map to find half of it coloured green with a great blue stain in the centre
2725,kielder water is beautiful and the kielder trees formidably impressive in@ their domination of@ the hills
2726,but by@ the time i had turned off the road from bellingham at kielder village and driven up@ the bumpy forest drive to east kielder farm i was longing for@ the sight of@ something other than water and trees
2727,relief@ was at@ hand@ 
2728,the farm stands@ on a spur@ of moorland on the northern edge of the forest and within@ # minutes i had turned my back on@ the corduroy@ battalions@ of trees and was striding under a still cloudy sky over tussocks of rush and coarse grass with@ my face to the long bare@ shoulders@ of@ open@ hillside that flank the winding shallows of the east kielder burn
2729,the footpath that runs@ with the burn is not one of those@ carefully waymarked and leafleted by the forestry commission
2730,there are few attractions@ for@ the kielder tourist here
2731,the burn threads@ a wild and inhospitable@ crevice of the hills where the wind blows@ cold and the sense@ of@ isolation@ grows@ with@ each lonely@ mile
2732,walking here you leave@ the #th century behind@ on@ the outskirts@ of the forest and enter@ the reconstructed@ emptiness in@ which the reivers and cross-border raiders of@ the past could operate@ unhindered
2733,i squelched across tiny burns running@ in@ black channels of peat and stood looking down from the hillside on to the grey roofs of scaup farm
2734,the hollow@ barking of@ a dog came@ from one of the stone sheds but there was no sign@ of@ life around the buildings
2735,scaup must be just about the loneliest@ farm in england tucked@ down in@ the shelter of@ the hills with@ kielder forest's dark@ mass blocking@ its southward view and the narrowing valley of the burn filling@ half the sky to the north
2736,the east kielder burn divides here into@ scaup burn and white kielder burn
2737,i dropped down the hill to ford white kielder upstream of the ruined farmstead of kielder head where a line@ of stunted alders shaggy@ with lichen leaned@ over their leafless reflections in the peat-brown water
2738,spring comes@ late to@ this@ windbitten@ and rain-soaked valley
2739,but there were new-born lambs in the sheep pens of scaup and a cheery hello now from the farmer and his wife tending them
2740,those@ were the last human voices i heard all day
2741,no-one lives up here in the cleft of the white kielder burn
2742,the rough land is altogether too harsh@ and unyielding giving@ sustenance only to sheep and to the conifers high on the flanks@ of east kielder moor and grey mares knowe immense sweeps@ of hillside to right and left of the valley
2743,the footpath on the left bank of the burn was little better than a sheep track but there were clues@ to@ its former importance as a droving road over the hills to byrness in redesdale
2744,large boulders stood out beside the path as grey blobs@ in the featureless sheets@ of pale@ grass and flat stones had been placed bridges@ across the burns their backs@ hollowed by the tread of@ feet through@ the centuries
2745,following@ these@ now disregarded signs@ of@ past activity along the old path i traversed the hillside and came down to a crumbling stone sheepfold with@ the roofless remains of a shepherd's hut built into one wall

2751,now the path ran@ through heather high above the burn past circular sheepfolds long disused and over the stony beds@ of side streams where the grass hung smooth and inviting concealing ankle-breaking@ drops
2752,a mile above the shepherd's hut the hillsides ceased@ their upward rolling@ and curved together to form@ a dead-end valley of broad@ breasted@ slopes five miles from the nearest tarmac road hidden deep in the folds@ of the moors
2753,the old drover's road turned@ aside here and climbed@ under the rock faces@ of white crags to continue its lonely@ course over girdle fell and down into redesdale
2754,i could have gone with@ it giving@ myself four blissful miles of@ upland walking followed@ by as many miserable hours of@ fruitless searching for@ return transport to east kielder farm
2755,instead i lay back in the heather and savoured@ the trickle of the burn and the crisp@ smell of peat-laden ground

2757,there were five miles of@ return tramping to face@ but they too could wait@ awhile 
2758,travel a pilgrimage@ sans@ progress@ elisabeth de stroumillo potters round poitou
2759,by elisabeth de stroumillo
2760,people tend to look@ vague@ when you mention poitou
2761,umm not a part@ of france we know where exactly is it
2762,inland of la rochelle you say north of cognac and east of limoges
2763,you sort of pass it without@ realising going to the dordogne
2764,ah yes cognac
2765,nice is it
2766,well better than that@ and one of the best things@ about@ it is the fact that so few people except the french themselves bother with@ it
2767,even for france the variety to be found@ is enormous@ 
2768,my passion is for its numerous romanesque churches in@ most cases humbly@ proportioned but elevated@ into@ unique works of art by the richness of their exquisitely-sculpted decoration to go to poitou saintonge and not look at any of its churches would be going@ to@ anafrican@ game@ reserve@ and ignoring@ the animals@ 
2769,for serious@ drinkers there is the production of cognac to investigate around cognac plus the chance to sample pineau the powerful@ local aperitif made from young@ wine laced@ with cognac
2770,to the north where poitou borders@ on@ the vendee shapely clumps@ of trees are almost the only punctuation@ marks@ on widespreading marshy landscapes to the south it bubbles@ with@ little@ rolling hills
2771,water is everywhere canals streams small busy@ rivers with@ charming names like the boutonne the mignon and the belle and big lazy@ rivers like the sevre niortaise and the charente
2772,the lower reaches of the sevre niortaise are swollen with the waters that once covered the whole area until medieval monks started to dig a spider-web@ of ditches to drain it
2773,now the marais poitevin is a pleasantly low@ profile@ tourist attraction where you can take@ canal-boat trips@ from villages that have hardly changed in@ the #-odd years i've known them maillezais with a huge and rather dull@ ruined abbey and coulon where i first ate the delicious local version of moules marinieres called mouclade
2774,drifting@ between grassy polders to which farmers have to ferry their cattle in punts or following@ leafy twisting@ lanes marked@ only by rusty signs proclaiming@ the venise verte you're in@ an all-green mysteriously silent@ world@ only the occasional fisherman twitching his rod above the algae-smothered@ waters disturbs@ the stillness
2775,there is more greenery further south in the deep forest of chize with the fine@ renaissance chateau of dampierre-sur-boutonne at its edge and more marshes tothe west around rochefort and marennes where those@ mussels and oysters are raised@ 
2776,one of the region's strangesttownlets sits@ on those@ marshes brouage
2777,somnolent@ now within its low grey walls and stumpy towers it was once rich@ on@ salt and powerful@ to boot
2778,it had@ a son@ to be proud@ of samuel champlain founder of quebec who was born there around@ #
2779,a century later it had@ an adoptive@ daughter@ to weep@ for #-year-old marie mancini niece of louis xiv's minister mazarin
2780,she went there when her romance with the young king was quashed@ for political reasons
2781,months later when marie had departed louis is said to have paused nostalgically at brouage on his way to paris after@ marrying the spanish infanta at st jean-de-luz
2782,as you come back from brouage towards st jean-d'angely on the d# via the canalside village of pont-l'abbe-d'arnoult with a lovely romanesque church faade a sign at the junction of the d# points@ you to the chateau whose improbably perfect lake and gardens stare@ at you from posters throughout the region la roche courbon
2783,its most surprising room covered from ceiling to floor in@ #th-century paintings should be a salon or library instead a dotty stone bathtub was set into one wall at@ a later date by a lady called charlotte
2784,she never used it having got@ some of the plumbing details@ wrong
2785,wriggling@ across country on the d# to port-d'envaux you come to two more chateaux #th-century panloy flakingromantically away@ on its hillock overlooking a bend in the charente and almost next@ door@ the much older moated crazannes half-smothered@ in@ amazing flamboyant gothic carving
2786,crossing the autoroute and turning north on the d# brings@ you to st jean-d'angely by way of the isolated church of fenioux
2787,its conically-roofed tower hugged@ about by a brood@ of smaller roofs candle@ snuffers@ is visible for miles
2788,st jean-d'angely is a charming little town there are good shops as well as half-timbered houses along its narrow old streets one spanned by an ancient bell-tower
2789,there's also a renaissance fountain and an extremely odd@ conglomeration of church buildings comprising one ancient ruin one proper church and the skeleton@ faade and nave of a rather pompous@ and unfinished #th-century abbey
2790,it makes@ a conveniently central hub@ the marais poitevin village of coulon is # miles to the north by the d# which inexplicably changes@ its number at the top of a hill to@ d#
2791,niort is about@ the same distance by the parallel n#
2792,saintes with gallo-roman remains a beautiful romanesque abbey and an atmospheric@ medieval quarter is # miles south of st jean #-odd miles to the north-west is surgeres all of whose public buildings including an engagingly asymmetrical church are within the #th-century castle walls scattered among beautiful gardens and parkland perfect for picnicking
2793,just under@ # miles south-west of st jean on the brouage road st-savinien is at the upper limit of the tidal reaches of the charente
2794,the villagers' main hobby seems to be fishing with peculiar saucer@ nets suspended from precariously-perched bankside huts
2795,one fisherman waxed@ lyrical about@ the variety of fish in the river
2796,even salmon he assured me but of course those@ are protected and must be thrown back@ 
2797,which they are normalement
2798,like almost every other poitevin town and village st-savinien has@ a sweet@ romanesque church melle indeed has@ three
2799,but aulnay just over@ # miles north-east of st jean is probably the best its unassuming@ architecture a perfect frame@ for the sheer@ artistry of the carvings round its doors and windows
2800,biblicalmotifs@ recur some art-experts themsermons@ in@ stone@ and their messages@ would certainly have been clear@ to@ the often-illiterate medieval pilgrims trudging to santiago de compostela in spain
2801,but these@ themes are always interspersedwith@ more fanciful ones grimacing@ masks weird animals exuberant@ abstract patterns
2802,i think those@ #thand #th-century sculptors were motivated not just by piety but also by a certain competitive spirit@ if a church was finer@ than the one in the next village more pilgrims would surely pause there

2804,way@ of the world@ farming notes
2805,by auberon waugh
2806,many will take@ it as a further surrender@ to@ common market bureaucracy that an inspectorate will soon be established to regulate@ the smell of farm manure
2807,in@ fact with@ the development of deep-litter hen houses and intensive pig culture some such controls@ are necessary
2808,the smell released@ by a pig or chicken farm is indescribable and can affect # square miles of countryside around
2809,one may doubt whether modern farming has@ any useful purpose nowadays when everybody is on@ a diet
2810,it mostly seems to involve@ producing food for animals to eat whose excrement is then collected to assist@ the growth of more food for animals
2811,small@ children can sometimes be persuaded to eat cow cake@ in@ the same way@ that old people will eat cat food but the chief@ result of all this@ farming was to produce huge food mountains@ which we could then refuse to give@ to the third world@ or to the socialists of eastern europe in order to teach them the error of their ways@ 
2812,however there is a new@ plan@ to turn@ land over@ to@ wind farming
2813,it involves@ nothing more than putting up #-foot masts@ all over the land
2814,a #-acre grouse moor will generate enough electricity in@ this@ way@ to power a town of # people
2815,the farmer receives a rent of # a year and is relieved@ of the need to do any work for it
2816,all the food we need will be provided by monster underground funguses producing a regular@ crop of mushrooms without@ human assistance
2817,the masts@ may seem unsightly to@ those@ unused to@ them@ but i am sure it is simplya matter of getting accustomed
2818,cows were thought very unsightly when they were first introduced@ 
2819,nowadays we all swoon@ with@ pleasure at@ the sight of a cow
2820,luxury life awaits@ private jail inmates

2827,nail clippers combs toothpaste and toothbrushes razors and washbags are neatly laid out on tables in the cells to await@ the arrival of inmates many of whom will not be carrying such items because they may not have expectedto be remanded in@ custody
2828,the cells are luxurious compared to@ some of the things@ we put up with in@ the army said one staff member@ during a press tour of the jail
2829,the prison has@ a medical block@ with # beds and a gym with equipment that staff said@ would be the envy@ of many council leisure centres

2839,by martyn harris
2840,at the drop-in centre on south meadowell labour candidate paddy cosgrove has dropped in to meet the people mostly fat ladies in shellsuits with@ laps full of chips
2841,you all know me says paddy and a fat lady with@ good timing says i don't know you
2842,never seen you in@ me life
2843,on the floor a toddler peels more chips from a congealed bluish mass and feeds them to a baby
2844,another digs@ the cream from the centre of a pink fancy and smears it in his hair
2845,paddy cosgrove councillor and barrister in candidates' pinstripes sits tensely@ on the edge of his plastic chair
2846,i'm a regular@ visitor to this estate
2847,who does he say he is says a second fat lady
2848,that@ liberal paddy ashgrove
2849,he's better looking on@ tv
2850,he's only come because the press are here says the first fat lady
2851,and paddy cosgrove blushes
2852,political consciousness@ is low@ on the meadowell estate
2853,turnout at@ the last election was around@ # per cent and with@ the thinning@ of the electoral roll@ brought@ by the poll tax will be even lower@ this@ time
2854,they are mostly labour voters but several confuse their labour candidate with@ the leader of the liberal democrats
2855,very few know their mp is a conservative and hardly anyone that his name is neville trotter defender@ of a slender@ # majority
2856,by most measures@ meadowell is the worst council estate in britain and probably the most notorious since the riots last september which followed@ the deaths of joyriders colin atkins and dale robson in@ a police chase
2857,in@ fact meadowell is an elastoplast@ name like sizewell invented in@ the # to disguise@ what was already a running@ sore@ 
2858,when built in@ # it was the ridges which is still what they call it locally a slum clearance project on the north bank of the tyne # miles east of newcastle
2859,its first inhabitants were shipyard and fishquay workers from the riverside towns of north shields and wallsend who moved happily from their tumbledown terraces to these@ fine@ new houses with inside toilets and gardens
2860,many like ronnie collyer a retired shipyard worker still live here and are still proud of the place
2861,all the trouble says ronnie is down@ to@ a few families who doan't keep their young uns in@ order@ 
2862,and then the media coom@ down@ and blow@ everything up@ 
2863,he has@ polished shoes a close shave and too much pride for a free@ drink
2864,it's a canny@ place the ridges with plenty of good folk
2865,but something was wrong from@ the start@ 
2866,some say it was the importing@ of whole@ streets of fighting@ families from the fishquays with@ their dockland diversions@ of prostitution drug-dealing and handling@ 
2867,others say it was the shortage of pubs shops churches transport and police stations
2868,by@ the # the ridges was the criminal ghetto@ of newcastle and by@ the # a costly@ council manicure@ job had turned it into@ a free-fire zone
2869,paths and boundaries@ vanished@ allowing@ the tides@ of street life to wash@ right up to@ the doorsteps
2870,joyriders used front lawns to practise their handbrake turns
2871,car theft became so common that private cars virtually disappeared from the area
2872,shops like greengrocers and chippies with@ pitiful@ cash takings were routinely subjected to@ armed robberies with shotguns balaclavas the whole@ bit@ 
2873,when i ask the fat ladies atthe drop-in centre what is the one thing@ that would do@ most to improve the estate they say get rid of the kids and they are only half joking
2874,the age structure@ of meadowell means@ it is awash@ withteenagers whose only pastimes are having@ babies and body-building
2875,do your husbands come here
2876,i ask and they all laugh
2877,the men are all useless@ sitting indoors if there's trouble in the street
2878,it's women have to go out and deal@ with@ it
2879,by@ the time of the riots a quarter of all houses on the estate were boarded up and burned out by infant@ petrol bombers
2880,unemployment was # per cent on@ some streets
2881,in@ meadowell primary which has@ # children every one was receiving a clothing grant
2882,the area had effectively been abandoned@ by the authorities a fact which became clear@ during the riot itself when police waited five hours to enter the estate and put@ down@ the disturbances
2883,and there were never more than a few dozen ringleaders bob mather a local butcher tells me
2884,i was stood outside me shop all night and most were no more than kids
2885,eight months on@ and little has changed if anything it is rather worse
2886,unemployment is up@ another # per cent more houses and shops are boarded up burglaries and joyriding continue and if there is less ram-raiding it is only because # or so of the hardest@ cases are still behind@ bars@ 
2887,a food co-op which tried@ to replace the burned-out shops has been closed after@ several break-ins and even the drop-in centre is burgled weekly according to project worker sheila auld
2888,there is a new phone box ripped from the wall and lying on the floor of her office to prove it
2889,meadowell has even discovered@ a new martyr in@ the shape of one willy hunter a local hard@ nut@ awaiting trial for murder and allegedly the victim@ of a police frame-up
2890,free willy hunter say@ the graffiti next to the old fading graffiti for dale robson and colin atkins
2891,my friend kevin muscleman and minicab driver says the lads would be out rioting for willy now if it wasn't tipping@ down with rain the whole@ time
2892,a few things@ have been achieved i suppose
2893,there are some posh flats going up atneighbouring royal quays which will provide building jobs it's sun@ city@ in the middleof bantustan@ a labour councillor said to@ me
2894,the cheviot housing association is slowly@ taking over property in south meadowell
2895,a new police station is to be built
2896,the government sponsored meadowell initiative makes@ noises@ in@ the north of the estate but does@ pitifully@ little painfully@ slowly@ 
2897,north tyneside council says@ it is too starved@ of funds by central@ government to do@ much
2898,tory ministers like michael heseltine who visited meadowell last november say the cash shortages are due to council profligacy and bad management
2899,mp neville trotter is a pear-shaped@ tory with@ pear-shaped@ vowels who has@ little appeal@ to@ the people of meadowell and a dwindling appeal@ in@ the middle-class suburbs where unemployment is also climbing@ 
2900,paddy cosgrove his likely replacement is a council hack@ of # years standing and ideal backbench fodder@ though it is hard@ to imagine him leading@ a crusade@ for meadowell
2901,when i ask the people of the estate what they want from@ this@ election some say they want cheviot to rebuild@ it and others that it would be better grassed over
2902,some say they should bring@ back@ hanging others say it is the politicians they should hang but most say there is nothing anybody can do at all

2905,sit@ they said but he wouldn't this@ week john major began to appear on@ a different kind of box@ 
2906,in@ the last of his series on@ the leaders frank johnson reports
2907,by frank johnson
2908,we were in the west country
2909,the prime minister was on@ his soapbox@ 
2910,just up@ the road at langport in somerset was the birthplace of walter bagehot ## although as he directed@ his microphone atliberal democrat hecklers john major had@ other things@ on@ his mind
2911,the relevance is that bagehot was the first political commentator
2912,the travelling chaos@ of a modern party leader's election entourage had carried@ major within a few miles of the home of the founder of the profession a few of whose more troublesome contemporary practitioners are said to have caused him much irritation@ over@ the # months of his premiership
2913,a liberal
2914,he's admitted@ to@ being a liberal
2915,major cried jabbing a finger in@ the direction of one heckler
2916,the man had@ a liberal democrat rosette pinned to his cap
2917,he was also carrying an orange poster on a pole urging@ a vote for the local liberal democrat candidate
2918,therefore the admission which the prime minister wrung@ from@ him could hardly be said to have been grudging
2919,but like all the best soapbox orators major had prepared@ his repartee in@ advance@ 
2920,i knew there was one here he continued meaning liberal democrats
2921,there were in@ fact about@ a score@ 
2922,then came@ the passage@ which appeared on@ the television news that@ evening and in@ the papers the next@ day about@ the liberal democrats being the trojan@ horse@ that would let@ labour in@ 
2923,there were also some lines@ intended for local consumption@ higher@ petrol prices from@ the liberal democrats that@'s not gonna help@ a rural area
2924, what would bagehot have made@ of him
2925,like the heckler he was a liberal
2926,there@ the similarity ends since judging@ from@ his writings bagehot was a roaring@ snob whereas judging@ from@ his heckles the heckler was not
2927,more to@ the point@ it was bagehot who said a constitutional@ statesman is in general a man of common opinions and uncommon abilities
2928,the statesman to@ whom he was referring@ was peel
2929,a political commentator of our own day paul johnson quoted it not long after major became prime minister to suggest@ that it was also true of him
2930,but is it still
2931,b agehot's phrase comes@ in@ a passage@ in@ which he appears to propound the dispiriting theory that a politician if he wants to get@ anywhere@ must appeal@ to@ the average@ man
2932,the average@ man is a cool@ common person with@ a considerate@ air with@ figures in@ his mind with@ his own businessto attend@ to@ with@ a set of ordinary opinions arising@ from@ and suited@ to@ ordinary life
2933,he can't bear@ novelty or originalities
2934,original theories give@ trouble
2935,bagehot goes@ on@ to say of peel from@ a certain peculiarity of intellect and fortune he was never in@ advance@ of his time
2936,of almost all the great@ measures@ with@ which his name is associated he attained great@ eminence as an opponent before he attained even greater@ eminence as their advocate@ 
2937,that@ last sentence has@ more to do@ with@ kinnock than with@ major
2938,it is also a warning to@ all hack@ tories who think that it is a telling blow@ against@ kinnock to keep on pointing@ out@ that he has reversed@ his opinions about@ unilateral nuclear disarmament british membership of the ec or anything else
2939,but the most striking thing@ about@ bagehot's essay on@ peel in the light of the last full@ week of this@ election campaign@ is that it simply does not apply@ to@ major at all
2940,common opinions were what got@ major into@ difficulties in@ the first place@ 
2941,between@ his becoming prime minister and his party's fall@ in@ the polls about@ # days ago major did nearly everthing that common opinion wanted@ him to do
2942,this@ was true@ of what he did about@ both high@ policy and low@ politics
2943,for example on@ high@ policy common opinion said@ that there was nothing for it but to stay@ in@ the erm
2944,he stayed@ in@ and the recession worsened
2945,in@ low@ politics common opinion no less common for being expensively hired@ by conservative central office encouraged@ him in@ the belief that he should fight@ much of the election sitting down
2946,he did so and he looked like the questioner in the studio audience rather than the answerer
2947,the result was wobbly week the second week of the campaign@ 
2948,but last saturday major climbed@ on@ to@ that@ soapbox@ in luton
2949,until@ then he had been that@ most inhuman of creatures the public figure described by others as very human
2950,now he really was human unscripted jokey even a bit passionate
2951,the jubilant@ word from@ kinnock's camp@ was that major was behaving more like an opposition leader than a prime minister
2952,but there seemed nothing wrong with@ the head@ of government appearing to be the challenger@ on@ the hustings
2953,president truman did so in@ a campaign@ which no-one expected him to win and he won
2954,it is justified@ if the head@ of government is challenging@ something powerful@ 
2955,kinnock complains of the alleged power of the tory tabloid press but he has@ powers@ on@ his side@ too
2956,ninety per cent of his party's cash comes@ from@ the unions which will expect@ a return@ 
2957,the british people have in@ the past found@ them rather more powerful@ than the corporations which are popularly supposed to finance the conservative party
2958,then there are all those@ schoolteachers dons television producers writers on@ arts pages and members@ of the agitatingclasses who want@ a labour win in order to impose political correctness
2959,that is to say they will have@ what the jesuits once attached@ such importance to@ power@ over@ young or impressionable minds
2960,as the week went@ by@ major rejected common opinion about@ two other large@ subjects@ proportional representation and scottish devolution
2961,he hardened@ his opposition to@ both despite the fact that his own party chairman had once favoured the first and vocal forces@ within@ his scottish party were in support of the second
2962,e ven at@ this@ late hour psephology demographics and luck suggest@ that the tories could still emerge@ as the biggest@ single party in@ a hung@ parliament
2963,is it possible that major would rather go@ into@ opposition with@ the dangers@ that@ would mean@ for his continued leadership of the conservative party than offer pr and scottish devolution to@ the liberal democrats
2964,if so we are dealing@ with@ a more quixotic romantic or principled figure than some of us used to think
2965,once that@ soapbox@ came@ out@ major campaigned as if he would now do and say what he really thought
2966,was it too late
2967,from@ central office and from@ around his entourage came@ the unmistakable signs@ of fair@ weather@ friendspreparing@ to detach@ themselves from@ blame for defeat
2968,and then on@ thursday morning when major's election tour reached@ the daily mail ideal home exhibition sir david english the paper's editor was not there to greet him
2969,a junior@ spin doctor is reported to have muttered though admittedly out of my earshot we've been snubbed
2970,not sir david
2971,some in@ the profession of political commentating would opt for bagehot as their formative influence but mine has long been sir david a founder of biased tory journalism
2972,his lack of humbug about@ political balance@ has always made@ him more honest than all the employees of bbc current affairs awaiting with@ glee the kinnock years
2973,eventually sir david's office issued@ a statement about@ the prime minister
2974,normally a prime minister's office would issue@ a statement about@ an editor
2975,but major makes@ a point@ of not being grand and with@ sir david it is the other way@ about@ 
2976,sir david english was not informed of the visit and in@ consequence had@ no plans@ to attend the ideal home exhibition that@ day the official statement announced@

2978,scientists click@ over@ a way@ to save dolphins
2979,by greg neale environment correspondent
2980,hundreds of thousands of dolphins could be saved from@ death thanks@ to@ pioneering work by british scientists
2981,they believe they have found@ a cheap practical means@ of preventing dolphins entangling themselves in monofilament drift fishing nets the walls@ of death believed to be responsible@ for killing large numbers of dolphins off cornwall this@ year
2982,but their work is hampered@ by lack of money
2983,so far@ they have received@ nothing from@ the government little ec assistance@ and are running@ out@ funds donated@ by individuals and industry
2984,the researchers headed@ by dr margaret klinowska a cambridge biologist and david goodson an expert on@ acoustic engineering at@ loughborough university say@ new@ data shows@ that plastic sound reflectors@ to fishing nets can warn@ dolphins of hazards
2985,data to be published shortly draws on experiments including observations of freddy the dolphin that has been living off the northumbrian coast for four years
2986,using equipment donated@ by racal the scientists have analysed recordings of the clicking dolphins make while hunting
2987,observations of freddy led@ them to conclude that dolphins use@ sonar while hunting

3045,by lewis jones
3046,charity is a divine attribute but we are enjoined to give forgetfully lest we fall@ into@ the absurd error of mistaking ourselves for gods
3047,the perils of ignoring this@ advice were well illustrated@ by angel of bengal c# the true stories documentary by anna raphael which was by turns@ hilarious and enraging
3048,the angel@ in@ question was an american woman who calls herself rytasha
3049,apart from a particularly vicious@ nose-job and alarming turquoise-coloured contact lenses rytasha is rather beautiful and in@ the # when she went@ by the name of ricki she was a successful model@ she began life as maxine shenkman
3050,an earlier film by raphael the persuaders # charted@ the transformation of ricki into@ rytasha which occurred@ at the hare krishna temple in london and her uneasy@ relationship with@ her guru there
3051,it would have been interesting to have seen the two films together@ 
3052,since # rytasha has broken@ away@ from@ her guru and set@ up@ on@ her own with@ a charity called food relief international which raises@ money from the fiercelycompetitive matrons of palm beach and distributes@ it to the starving people of bangladesh
3053,she adaws bangladesh gushed@ rytasha's mother the fiercest matron of them all rejoicing in@ the improbable title of baroness thea von theilheimer shenkman
3054,she went@ on@ to list her daughter's achievements she put in an irritation@ system
3055, with@ no trace@ of a smile or a blush the baroness quickly@ corrected herself an irrigation system but the slip@ was a telling one@ and i'm sure they would have appreciated it@ in bangladesh
3056,the villagers of ramsala recipients of the palm beach dollars explained@ to@ the cameras that they desperately needed a clinic
3057,we told her that a mud hut would do@ but she said no she'd build something pukka
3058,a pukka building was duly erected but its medical function has somehow been indefinitely postponed
3059,it is devoted@ instead to@ the worship@ of the charitable rytasha who is not content simply to hand over the cash but insists in@ an unfortunate@ hangover@ from@ her hare krishna days on@ posturing as a spiritual master
3060,the villagers seemed unimpressed but were given@ no choice in@ the matter
3061,nor could the vaunted irrigation scheme be described as an unqualified@ success
3062,the money ran out before@ the scheme's completion and the villagers found@ themselves obliged to borrow the rest
3063,they begged rytasha for reimbursement but none was forthcoming and for the want of a few hundred pounds the village lost@ its crop for the year
3064,now what are we supposed to do asked one of them
3065,are we to sell our cattle or our land
3066,the most irritating thing@ about@ rytasha and there were many@ was that though she does not speak their language she presumes to teach them a spurious form@ of their own religion

3083,by karen cooper
3084,more than # lloyd's of london members@ on@ syndicates managed@ by the loss-making gooda walker agency have failed in@ their legal attempt to prevent lloyd's and members@' agents from@ drawing@ down@ their funds
3085,michael freeman the solicitor who advised the members@ on@ court action said yesterday this@ will cause the most dreadful hardship
3086,there is going to be a great@ deal@ of pain@ in@ the market@ place@ now
3087,in@ an earlier than expected commercial court judgment mr justice saville found@ that the members@ had not produced@ enough evidence of irregularities@ in@ the lmx spiral@ which sends@ catastrophe risks swirling@ round@ the market@ to stop@ the usual process of calling@ on@ cash deposits@ to make@ good syndicate losses
3088,however he suggested there was perhaps a need to look@ into@ the system@ more closely
3089,costs were awarded to@ the members@' agents but not to lloyd's
3090,the members@ many of whom are unable to fulfil the latest #m cash call@ due on@ march # to cover@ ## losses on@ syndicates were seeking@ an interim injunction to stop@ members@' agents and lloyd's dipping@ into@ their security
3091,they were challenging@ the pay now sue later principle at@ lloyd's which says@ names should pay@ cash calls@ first and fight@ them later
3092,lloyd's chairman david coleridge welcomed@ the judgment
3093,we have@ every sympathy with@ those@ who have made@ substantial@ underwriting losses in@ recent years but lloyd's owes@ its first duty@ to policyholders with@ valid claims which must be met@ he said
3094,mr freeman said an appeal was most unlikely because we are not going to get@ any more evidence
3095,earlier this@ month preliminary findings from@ an investigation by kenneth randall found@ that the gooda walker agency may have overstated@ its syndicates' profits between@ # and # through@ the use@ of time and distance@ policies about@ which it had failed@ to inform its auditors in@ at least one syndicate
3096,peter nutting who led@ the association of outhwaite members@ to@ a succesful@ settlement@ said he sympathised with@ gooda walker names but if the names were not going to pay@ these@ calls@ who did they think was going to pay them@

3099,the nhs is not for sale virginia bottomley talks to@ george jones in@ her first interview since joining@ the cabinet
3100,by george jones
3101,the new health secretary mrs virginia bottomley set@ herself an ambitious@ target@ yesterday to take@ the politics out of@ the national health service
3102,but her desire to provide a period of stability@ for nearly one million people employed@ by the nhs is coupled@ with@ a fierce determination to maintain@ the momentum@ of reform with@ the overwhelming majority of hospitals becoming self-governing trusts by@ the mid-#
3103,labour sought@ to turn@ the general election into@ a referendum on@ the nhs asking@ voters for a mandate to reverse@ the changes
3104,mrs bottomley is convinced the tory victory provides the opportunity to entrench the reforms and to give@ doctors nurses and managers the confidence to make@ them work@ 
3105,in@ her first full@ interview since being appointed health secretary she said the election result and mr major's unequivocal commitment to@ the nhs had finally nailed@ the lie about@ privatisation of health care
3106,the nhs is not for profit
3107,it is not for sale
3108,it will continue to be true@ to@ its founding@ principles available to@ all and free@ at@ the point@ of delivery@ she said
3109,she recalled@ a promise made@ by mr major when he became prime minister that he would work for a nation at@ ease@ with@ itself
3110,i want to see@ a health service at@ ease@ with@ itself optimistic@ and confident@ about@ its essential work@ 
3111,health is something which touches@ every individual and family in the country she said
3112,but there must be changes
3113,an organisation that doesn't change fossilises@ 
3114,health needs to develop and alter 
3115,by@ next@ year she is confident that two thirds of hospitals will have become self-governing trusts within@ the nhs
3116,she pledged@ that the government would safeguard those@ that did not opt@ for trust status@ but she expected this@ to be a minority
3117,the government will also encourage@ more family doctors to hold@ budgets to buy services for patients and is looking@ at@ ways@ to enable@ smaller practices to team@ up@ to secure@ the advantages of fund holding@ 
3118,the election result has given@ the conservatives five years in@ which to press@ ahead@ with@ the changes
3119,most people are likely to judge the reforms on@ how long they have to wait for treatment the issue behind@ the jennifer's ear controversy during the election campaign@ 
3120,mrs bottomley stressed@ her commitment to@ the patient's charter which has already eliminated almost all waits of more than two years for nhs operations
3121,the next@ step@ is to ensure that from@ march no one should have to wait more than # months for a hip or knee replacement or a cataract@ operation
3122,a national standard@ will also be set@ for outpatient waiting times
3123,mrs bottomley's first big@ test as health secretary will come@ this@ summer with@ the annual public spending round@ which will be conducted@ against@ a background@ of concern over@ high@ government borrowing and pressure@ from@ the tory right for public spending cuts@ 
3124,the conservative manifesto contained@ a commitment to increase year by@ year the level@ of real resources@ committed@ to@ the nhs though it put@ no figure on@ the extra money to be allocated
3125,mrs bottomley representing caring@ conservatism will face mr michael portillo the new treasury chief secretary who is equally keen@ to establishhis right-wing@ credentials by demonstrating he can keep@ keep a tight@ grip@ on@ the public purse strings
3126,she acknowledged that there could be difficult times ahead@ 
3127,it will always be the case that the holder@ of my office will need to fight@ the corner@ of the health service and there will always inevitably be more than we can do
3128,but she stressed@ there would be no let-up in@ the search for greater@ efficiency
3129,as well as fighting@ for more money her task was to ensure that every last pound was spent as effectively as it could be
3130,her priorities include giving@ more encouragement to@ medical research emphasis@ on@ preventive health to make@ the nhs a health as well as a sickness service with@ the publication shortly of new@ national targets@ for reducing@ deaths from@ heart disease and cancers and pressing@ ahead@ with@ care in@ the community@ 
3131,as a former psychiatric social worker mrs bottomley is determined to improve standards@ of care for mentally ill and handicapped people
3132,it is not acceptable to have@ people who require a home confined to long-stay institutions when they could be in more domestic settings@ 
3133,that@ is a real challenge@ she said
3134,mrs bottomley's rise@ to@ the top@ has been swift@ with@ only four years between@ her first ministerial post and a seat at@ the cabinet table
3135,but she bridles at@ suggestions that the inclusion of two women mrs gillian shephard at@ the department of employment and herself has excluded more able men from@ the cabinet
3136,prime ministers always have to consider@ balance@ in@ the cabinet and at least we now have@ the same number of women as old@ etonians in@ john major's team@ she said 
3137,a non-punitive paradigm of probation practice some sobering thoughts lr singer
3138,lawrence singer is an assistant chief probation officer with@ merseyside probation service
3139,beforehand he worked as a probation officer for berkshire probation service and later as a research officer for somerset probation service where he undertook the research reported here
3140,the paradigm which is describedoriginates@ from@ doctoral research into@ generic probation practice and has been presented@ in@ a book # gower
3141,summary
3142,the government white paper proposes@ a radical change for probation practice
3143,henceforth probation work will no longer be an alternative to@ punishment but an alternative form@ of punishment
3144,this@ article challenges@ the conceptual and practical appropriateness of applying@ the notion of punishment to@ the probation context@ 
3145,probation officers it is argued are concerned with@ establishing rules@ for probationers and not inflicting pain@ on@ them
3146,an alternative non-punitive paradigm of probation practice is described
3147,the paradigm is based@ on@ the joint supervisory aims@ of support@ and surveillance which are implemented through@ the methods of counselling assisting directing and monitoring
3148,to illustrate@ the paradigm reference is made@ to@ an alcohol education course@ developed for offenders in@ trouble through@ drink
3149,the efficacy of the alcohol project and the non-punitive paradigm is demonstrated bythe results reported from@ a three year evaluation study covering@ # offenders
3150,the article concludes@ with@ an affirmation of the disciplined but non-punitive character@ of current probation work and argues@ that to successfully protect the public and reintegrate offenders into@ the community the probation officer's employment of established social work knowledge skills and values is a strength@ not a weakness@ 
3151,the aim@ of this@ article is to challenge@ the assertion contained@ in@ the white paper home office #a that probation practice can be conceived@ of as a form@ of punishment in@ the community
3152,issue will be taken@ with@ the appropriateness of applying@ the concept of punishment to the probation context@ through@ reference to@ a demanding@ and successful@ probation project concerned@ with offenders in@ trouble through@ drink
3153,in@ describingthe project a non-punitive model@ for understanding probation practice will be developed
3154,this@ non-punitive paradigm will provide@ a framework@ for contrasting the efficacy of current practice with@ future plans@ inappropriately to transform@ probation work into@ a new approach@ to@ punishment in@ the community p # para #
3155,the punitive approach@ anticipated for the probation service in@ the white paper is underpinned@ bya definition of punishment that resides@ in@ the restrictions on@ liberty and in@ the enforcement of the orders@ 
3156,the white paper goes@ on@ to emphasize@ it is the loss@ of liberty involved in@ carrying out the terms@ of the order@ rather than the activities carried out during the order@ which is the punishment p # para #
3157,notwithstanding the popular appeal and political capital@ to be derived from@ such a humane-sounding@ statement this@ definition is nevertheless at@ variance with the traditional understanding of the meaning of punishment
3158,discourses on@ punishment and dictionary definitions of the term@ clearly@ specify the central@ feature@ of punishment as being the infliction of pain@ rather than the loss@ of liberty hudson #
3159,the conceptual and practical implications of this@ discrepancy will be examined in@ the third and final section@ of this@ article
3160,beforehand however consideration will be given@ first to@ the probation project and second to@ its evaluation
3161,in@ these@ sections@ punishment will be understood to mean the infliction of pain@ and the review of the project will seek@ to demonstrate that the probation practice described is not only more demanding@ but also more effective than this@ traditional understanding of punishment
3162,at@ a time when the home@ secretary is inviting@ the probation service to move@ centre@ stage@ in@ the criminal justice system@ nacro # p # it may seem misguided and unnecessarily pedantic to take@ issue with@ the white paper's notion of punishment
3163,punishment is just a word after@ all nothing more than convenient political rhetoric meriting only lip@ service@ from probation managers and practitioners poised at@ the window@ of opportunity
3164,however this@ fails to acknowledge a fundamental axiom of social work practice namely that language not only reflects@ but also shapes@ social reality
3165,as davies # has pointed@ out@ speech is the basic tool@ of the social worker
3166,what we say influences what we think and in@ turn@ what we do
3167,if punishment is assimilated@ into@ the probation glossary it will inevitably influence the sort of practice the service undertakes@ 
3168,in@ the sections@ to follow@ the stark@ question is therefore put@ is the probation service in@ the business of inflicting pain@ and the answer which unfolds@ may be summarized no because it neither aspires@ nor wishes@ to 
3169,the project more demanding@ than punishment
3170,government concern about@ the problem of drink-related offending is as old as the probation service
3171,indeed as bochel # has shown@ the establishment of a probation service in england and wales was inextricably linked@ with@ work undertaken with offenders in@ trouble through@ drink
3172,almost a century later the new approach@ to@ punishment in@ the community outlined@ bythe white paper once again presents@ alcohol misuse as a key problem requiring community-based intervention
3173,alcohol the white paper states@ is implicated in@ a wide@ variety of crimes drunken driving offences of public disorder and domestic violence p # para # #
3174,in@ describing@ its vision@ of effective supervision the white paper goes@ on@ to note@ 
3175,offenders take@ part@ in@ alcohol education programmes so that they can learn to drink sensibly
3176,they learn about@ the relative strength@ of different drinks the amount which is safe to consume and the pitfalls to avoid eg competitive drinking and buying rounds@ p # para #
3177,as a summary of alcohol education programmes this@ is something of a simplification
3178,however it does provide@ a useful introduction@ to@ the origins of the alcohol education course@ reported here
3179,furthermore it highlights@ the suitability of referring to@ this@ type of project for testing@ out@ the appropriateness of applying@ the notion of punishment to@ probation practice
3180,in@ # the management of somerset probation service was faced@ with@ the fact that nearly one in@ three of the offenders supervised in@ their area were either known to be or suspected of misusing alcohol singer #
3181,aware of practitioners' frustration in@ not being able to work effectively with these@ problematic clients probation management@ in@ partnership with@ the voluntary sector@ determined to developan alcohol education course@ aec
3182,by@ # when social inquiry report monitoring information covering@ # offenders indicated that the problem of drink-related offending was virtually as great for preas for post-sentence clients that is alcohol was cited as a pre-offence problem in@ twenty-nine per cent of cases a specialist project worker had been appointed
3183,towards@ the end@ of # an aec was launched@ and has been running@ ever since
3184,the aim@ of the course@ is to educate offenders about@ alcohol to facilitate a lasting change in@ their subsequent use of this@ drug
3185,this@ aim@ is underpinned@ bythree interrelated objectives and it is not without@ significance@ how they complement and serve@ to implement the white paper's own trinity of aims@ of supervision that is protection of the public prevention of reoffending and successful reintegration of the offender in@ the community p # para #
3186,these@ were
3187,#
3188,to increase@ knowledge about@ alcohol so that future alcohol use can be more informed and therefore more prudent
3189,#
3190,to instil or reinforce@ responsible drinking attitudes@ and behaviour
3191,#
3192,to encourage@ the maintenance@ of or where@ appropriate a reduction to@ a personally and socially safe level of alcohol unit intake
3193,to meet@ these@ objectives the aec has@ a structured programme involving group and individual contact@ that is six group sessions sandwiched@ between@ one-to-one interviews held@ immediately before@ and after@ the group 
3194,the initial one-to-one meeting held@ with one of the two group leaders serves@ to clarify what participants can expect from@ the course@ and what is expected of them
3195,a standard@ contract which covers@ conditions of attendance and an agreement to complete various assignments between@ group sessions is signed by each participant
3196,the final interview entails@ a personalized review of the course@ as well as the formulation@ of a follow-up plan@ to be undertaken with the offender's supervising officer
3197,the course@ employs@ a variety of materials@ and techniques including@ the use of checklists magazine and newspaper clippings quizzes videos brainstorm exercises@ discussions drink diaries and role plays menary #
3198,the aec is primarily intended for young adults subject to a probation order@ with@ a special condition of attendance schedule # #aii criminal justice act # and reflects@ the fact that most somerset offenders in@ trouble through@ drink commit@ serious@ offences and or possess a substantial@ number of previous convictions
3199,in short they are seriously at@ risk of committing@ further@ offences and becoming trapped in@ the revolving@ door@ of custody
3200,the developmentof the somerset aec both accords with and constitutes a practical example of the home office's recent guidance to@ sentencers
3201,in@ recent years the probation service has devoted increasing resources@ to@ supervising@ the more serious@ and persistent offenders
3202,probation orders@ which are combined@ with@ constructive@ disciplined and effective programmes of supervision are increasingly being usedfor offenders who stand@ to receive custodial sentences #b p #
3203,from@ the description@ of the aec already given@ the demanding@ and disciplined nature@ of the course@ can be appreciated
3204,however the course@ is not punitive it@ is not concerned@ with@ the infliction of pain@ 
3205,instead it@ is concerned@ with@ the establishment of rules@ 
3206,this@ is plainly@ evident from@ the section@ of the contract signed by each participant where@ what is expected of them is spelt@ out@ 
3207,you will be expected to keep a drink diary throughout@ the course@ and make@ attempts at@ reducing the amount you drink if it is greater than accepted healthy drinking levels
3208,you must be willing to be helped and help others your experiences will be useful to@ other group members@ 
3209,you must attend # sessions these@ will consist of an introductory session six group sessions and a final assessment interview
3210,you must not drink before@ the session
3211,you must be on@ time lateness will count@ as an absence
3212,unlike the prison inmate aec participants cannot sit@ back@ and passively do@ their time
3213,probation practice is not however solely concerned@ with@ the establishment of rules@ 
3214,as has been demonstrated elsewhere with regard to the generic probation setting@ singer # the supervision of offenders involves two overarching aims@ namely support@ and surveillance
3215,support@ refers to@ anything which is said or done to help the offender solve or mitigate their personal or social problems surveillance to@ anything which is said or done to induce the offender to conform to@ socially acceptable standards@ of behaviour
3216,these@ aims@ are implemented through@ the practice of four distinguishable but related methods
3217,in terms of support@ there is counselling and assisting in terms of surveillance there is directing and monitoring
3218,each of these@ four methods are employed@ during the eight sessions
3219,although summarized as an alcohol course@ the sessions are not just concerned@ with@ giving@ information but also with@ enabling participants to make@ practical useof it
3220,in@ the first group session the counselling method is registered in@ the course@ tutor's notes menary # bythe explanation this@ session aims@ to get@ participants to consider the subject@ of alcohol in@ ways@ they had not thought of in@ the past p #
3221,during this@ session the importance of monitoring is also emphasized@ 
3222,drinks exercises@ introduce@ the notion of measurement concentration of alcohol content information which will be necessary to carry out the recording of alcohol consumption throughout the duration of the course@ p #
3223,in@ the fifth group session entitled focus@ on@ the individual the counselling and the monitoring combine with@ the directing and assisting methods
3224,at@ the start of the session the tutor's notes make@ clear@ that directing@ extends@ beyond@ enforcing the conditions of attendance
3225,this@ session allows@ for an indepthexamination of the drinking diaries over@ the last five weeks identifying the risky circumstances or situations@ 
3226,the aim@ at@ the end@ of the session is to encourage participants to make@ rules for their future drinking which will lead@ to@ a lessening of identified problems p #
3227,similarly the assisting extends@ beyond@ simply providing handouts of useful information 
3228,it is important that participants are provided with the skills to reduce@ their drinking levels or handle@ more effectively pub centred problems
3229,the useof role play incorporating previously discussed difficulties ie homework assignment session # in real or set@ up@ situations@ provides an opportunity for testing these@ skills
3230,probably the best illustration@ of the assisting method in@ action during the course@ comes@ in@ the fifth session when somerset practitioners take@ the logic of working with@ the problem in@ the community to@ its ultimate conclusion
3231,in@ the second half@ of the session course@ leaders sponsor participants to@ an evening at the pub for the purpose of practising drinking skills and purchasing non-alcoholic drinks
3232,the counselling assisting directing and monitoring on@ the aec give@ substance@ to@ the aims@ of support@ and surveillance and provide the basis for establishing a model@ of probation practice
3233,punishment has@ no place@ in@ this@ model@ 
3234,instead the aec can best be understood as an example of a non-punitive paradigm of probation practice
3235,twenty years ago the advisory council on@ the penal system@ observed@ that notions of punitiveness do not accord with@ the british concept of probation as an alternative to rather than a suspension@ of punishment quoted in@ bochel # p #
3236,twenty years later the aec demonstrates@ that this@ remains no less true now than it was then
3237,but does the aec work@ 
3238,bringing@ fossils back@ to@ life@ 
3239,in@ this@ chapter some of the ways@ in@ which palaeontologists determine the way@ fossil animals lived are described reanimating@ the dead fragments to build@ up@ a living@ creature@ 
3240,since popular ideas of life in@ the past are often founded@ on@ vividly@ coloured@ reconstructions@ of the world in@ the jurassic period and the like it is important to remember that these@ imaginative scenes@ are all inferences from@ bones and similar fragments
3241,in@ fact there is nothing fixed@ about@ such interpretations because the way@ the fossils are understood may change@ over@ the years but it is usually some time before new discoveries percolate@ into@ the popular presentations
3242,even the most solid-looking dinosaurs may have changed@ their habits@ in@ the last few years
3243,many different lines@ of evidence may be usedto flesh out the bare bones of the fossils
3244,the first of these@ is the evidence of the rocks from which the remains were recovered
3245,the sediments themselves reveal@ much about@ the environment of deposition as was shown@ in@ chapter #
3246,it is important to establish whether the fossil animal actually lived in the environment which furnished@ its sedimentary cover or whether its remains were swept@ in from some other place
3247,fortunately it is usually easy to spot such intruders@ 
3248,the type of sediment and the associated fossils will show@ whether the environment was marine freshwater or terrestrial providing the basic information into@ which the ecology of the animal has to be accommodated@ 
3249,the sediments themselves may have preserved@ some of the tracks left by the animal p # to give@ direct@ evidence of its past activities@ 
3250,from@ the tracks alone it is possible to be certain of the bipedal stance@ of certain dinosaurs and to measure their stride@ 
3251,the character@ of the rocks and their setting in@ the past geography at@ the time when they accumulated diagnoses@ the climatic setting in@ which the extinct fauna lived and climate imposes@ certain restraints@ on@ possible modes of life
3252,savannah animals differ from@ those@ of tropical rain forests and these@ again from@ inhabitants@ of the tundra at@ high@ latitudes
3253,looking at@ the fossil animal itself the first necessity is to reconstruct it as accurately as possible from@ its fragmentary remains
3254,sometimes this@ is a very complex business particularly for vertebrates with numbers of small bones
3255,to proceed@ from@ the reconstruction@ to@ an assessment@ of probable life habits@ two different but complementary approaches@ are used 
3256,one method attempts@ to compare the structures of teeth or limbs or some other feature of the extinct animal with@ living 
3257,these@ do not have to be biologically related@ organisms
3258,the basic argument is that structures that are closely@ similar were probably adapted to@ a similar function
3259,sometimes these@ similarities are quite obvious the ferocious@ teeth of a predatory dinosaur are a sure indication of hunting habits@ with@ hardly a glance at@ the fangs of living mammalian carnivores
3260,but the structure and functioning of grinding or chewing teeth in@ other mammals in@ which opposing@ teeth co-operate@ in@ action and which can be matched in@ extinct unrelated@ mammals is a much more subtle matter involving detailed studies on@ the operation of living dental systems to help elucidate the functioning of fossil ones
3261,the technique of hunt@ the analogue is a favourite one practised by palaeontologists but it is certainly not a foolproof one because there are many fossil animals that defy@ comparison with@ living organisms and some analogues do not stand@ up@ to@ detailed scrutiny
3262,the second method tries@ to analyse the structure of the fossil almost it a piece@ of engineering@ 
3263,if the fossil is constructed in@ a certain way@ then there are only a limited number of jobs@ that the structure could perform@ 
3264,the idea here@ is to decide which of the possibilities is the most likely one
3265,this@ assumes@ that nature only manufactures@ efficient designs@ 
3266,for the most part this@ is a reasonable assumption to make@ 
3267,most animals today@ do seem to have bodies that accord@ well with@ the functions they have to carry out to survive flyers@ are aerodynamically efficient active swimmers@ have suitable streamlining herbivorous mammals have teeth appropriate for grinding plant food and so on
3268,ideally one could construct a model of the fossil to test out these@ various functions in@ experiments but the number of examples where@ the analysis has been pursued@ this@ far@ are limited
3269,of course it can never be known whether the right answer@ has been reached@ unless somebody dredges up a living fossil from the depths of the ocean there are only varying degrees of probability
3270,but the best answers@ are probably obtained@ where@ the functional design@ of the fossil points@ to@ the same life habits@ as a living analogue and where@ both are consistent@ with@ the geological circumstances in@ which the fossil remains occur
3271,swimming trilobites
3272,there are thousands of different kinds of trilobites
3273,all of them were marine and all of them are extinct
3274,since many kinds of trilobites co-existed at@ any one time they were probably occupying@ different ecological niches@ behaving in different ways@ corresponding with@ the wide@ variation in@ shape that they show@ 
3275,we can usethe methods described above@ to elucidate some of these@ occupations@ and get@ a glimpse@ albeit an imperfect one of the trilobite as it lived
3276,i will take@ an example where@ the methods can be used and where@ all point@ in@ the same direction@ so that the answer@ is probably correct
3277,most trilobites were broadly oval-shaped being rather longer than wide not greatly convex and with eyes that occupy@ perhaps a quarter of the length of the head
3278,there are a few trilobite species however with enormous globular eyes see below@ 
3279,byexamining the way@ these@ animals were put@ together@ it is possible to suggest a likely mode@ of life 
3280,giant-eyed ordovician trilobite seen from@ the top and side
3281,twice its natural size
3282,enlargement shows@ a section through the lenses to show@ the direction of the field@ of view
3283,we can take@ the eyes first
3284,the trilobite eye was of a compound type and each lens was made@ up@ of a calcite crystal
3285,from@ the optical properties of this@ mineral we know that the lens was able@ to interpret@ light coming@ from@ a direction more or less at@ right-angles to@ the lens surface
3286,so we can deduce what the field@ of vision of our@ globular-eyed trilobite was bylooking at@ the directions in@ which all the lenses face
3287,it turns@ out@ that our@ animal was able@ to see in@ almost every direction upwards downwards sideways and forwards and even backwards because the eyes bulged out beyond the line@ of the rest of the body
3288,most other trilobites have a predominantly lateral field@ of view
3289,if the animal lived on the sea bottom it seems unlikely that it would have eye lenses specialized for looking and we begin to suspect@ that the animal habitually@ dwelt above the sea floor
3290,other features of its shape are consistent@ with@ this@ 
3291,at the edge of the eyes are a pair of long spines and these@ point@ downwards at@ a steep angle at very awkward attitude for resting comfortably on the sea floor
3292,most normal trilobites have a more or less horizontal rim around the forward margin which may have rested on the sediment surface
3293,the thorax of the large-eyed trilobite is remarkably long compared with@ the average trilobite compare fig #
3294,the convex middle part of the thorax contained the musculature that operated@ the appendages which as usual are not preserved and the relatively large volume of this@ region shows@ that the musculature was powerful
3295,the construction of this@ giant-eyed trilobite suggests@ that it lived an actively swimming life well above the bottom and possibly in the surface waters of the sea
3296,of course because there are no living trilobites we cannot find@ direct@ confirmation of this@ hypothesis but we look@ for other arthropods that have the same modifications@ of the eyes for example in the present day oceans
3297,the analogy is found@ in@ such ocean-going amphipods a kind of shrimp as which also has@ enormously expanded eyes looking headlamps@ compared with@ its bottom-dwelling relatives@ above@ 
3298,in@ fact many of the arthropods that inhabit the water column@ have large globular eyes of this@ kind

3381,giant-eyed living crustacean 
3382,if it is correct that our@ trilobite lived above the sea bottom actively swimming in the water there are certain predictions we can make@ about@ its geological occurrence which can be tested bylooking in the rocks
3383,most bottom-dwelling trilobites preferred@ to live at a particular water depth or on a particular type of sea bottom mud sand or lime
3384,no such restriction should apply to@ our@ large-eyed species it should be found@ with@ all other different kinds of trilobite assemblages without@ preference
3385,this@ has been proved in several places in some arctic localities it is found@ with@ trilobites that lived at great depths in the muds of the ordovician ocean while in canada the same species occurs mixed with the inhabitants of the shallow-water seas where limestones were accumulating
3386,bythe same token@ the free-swimming trilobite may be expected to have@ a very wide geographical distribution for oceans would be no barrier@ to@ it
3387,and again this@ proves to be the case our@ example is found in arctic canada in the high arctic island of spitsbergen thousands of miles away in what is now@ the desert country of nevada and utah in the united states in western ireland in russia and in northwestern australia
3388,so in@ this@ case the different sources@ of evidence all point@ in@ the same direction@ whether derived from@ a detailed consideration of the way@ the trilobite is constructed@ or by analogy with@ living animals with@ similar adaptations or from@ the evidence of the rocks or the distribution of the fossils
3389,these@ giant-eyed trilobites of the ordovician were active swimmers@ in the surface waters as near@ certainly as we can ever know
3390,there are all kinds of different questions we can ask about@ the life habits@ of these@ trilobites which are not subject to the same kind of careful@ scrutiny
3391,what did they eat for example
3392,because we do not have the legs preserved it is not possible to see how the mouth appendages functioned in@ feeding and neither are the stomach contents preserved
3393,so here@ there are only more or less likely speculations
3394,active swimmers@ in the surface waters of the present@ oceans are likely to feed directly on@ the plankton and the trilobites may have had@ a method of harvesting@ large@ quantities of minute food
3395,or they may have been hunters after@ larger prey in@ which case when appendages are eventually discovered they may prove to have@ adaptations for grasping and manipulating larger food
3396,puzzles@ remain@ even though we can be certain of the rudiments of the story
3397,controversy among@ the giant dinosaurs
3398,the giant sauropod dinosaurs like were the largest land animals the world has seen@ they weighed more than # tonnes and present@ quite different problems in@ the interpretation of their life habits@ from@ the diminutive trilobites
3399,such spectacular animals have obviously attracted@ much attention and one might suppose that the problem of how they lived would have been satisfactorily solved long ago
3400,most of the popular books showing@ the mesozoic giants@ in their natural setting portray them wallowing about in swamps flanked bydeep vegetation their bodies largely under water
3401,surely an animal of this@ bulk it was argued must be partly supported bywater and their relatively inconsequential teeth must have been adapted for chewing on the kind of soft luxuriant vegetation that flourishes in and around swamps
3402,because their nasal openings were on the top of their heads they could even continue to breathe if it became necessary p # to totally submerge
3403,recently the life habits@ of the giants@ have been looked@ at@ in@ a way@ that disproves@ most of these traditional notions
3404,consider the structure@ of their legs
3405,the sauropods have relatively long pillar-@ legs resembling those@ of the elephant the largest land animal and may have been well adapted for supporting the huge bulk of the animal
3406,the feet of the sauropod are small relatively speaking@ with short stubby toes yet animals that walk on soft mud tend@ to have spreading feet to distribute their weight more evenly
3407,it is difficult to see@ how the compact feet of the sauropod could avoid@ becoming stuck fast in the soft muddy bottom of a lake
3408,if the dinosaur did after@ all live on dry land then the long neck could have usefully functioned to allow@ the animal to browse the high foliage of trees p #
3409,it has been suggested that an animal of the size of could not have breathed under water because of the pressure on the lungs
3410,their fossil remains seem to occur with other animals and plants which are generally accepted as terrestrial
3411,there is even some evidence from@ the tracks they have left behind that and its allies@ moved about in herds
3412,they may have been the gigantic reptilian analogue of the elephant and it may be no coincidence that the elephant also has its nasal openings on top of the skull with@ the nostrils in@ this@ case sited@ at the end of the trunk it has been suggested that some sauropods may have had@ a proboscis of some sort
3413,the balance@ of evidence seems to be swinging@ away from@ the original idea of swamp-dwelling giant dinosaurs to@ fully terrestrial habits@ 
3414,but other aspects@ of the dinosaur living habits@ are still more strongly@ debated
3415,in@ the last few years a powerful@ controversy has arisen@ over@ whether the dinosaurs as a whole were cold-blooded like all living reptiles and there is no doubt that dinosaurs reptiles or warm-blooded resembling mammals in@ this@ respect
3416,cold-blooded animals have to warm@ up@ before they can be fully active that@ is why lizards and snakes bask in the sun in@ temperate climates@ 
3417,for this@ reason they cannot cope@ with@ climates having@ greatly extended@ winters
3418,warm-blooded animals have@ the same body temperatures at@ all times and can be more continuously@ active but they use@ far@ more energy and hence need more food than cold-blooded animals of the same size
3419,the posture@ of many dinosaurs and particularly the carnivorous theropod dinosaurs was fully erect with@ the legs beneath the body and unlike the sprawling legs of living reptiles p #
3420,the long back legs of such hunters@ look highly suitable for running and as they did so the long tail may have been held erect as a kind of counter-balance p #
3421,for any kind of prolonged activity warm-bloodedness would have been a distinct advantage
3422,under the microscope even the bone structure@ of these@ dinosaurs looks more like that@ of living mammals than cold-blooded reptiles
3423,on@ the other hand@ it can be argued that the sauropods like were large and with@ a relatively small surface area through@ which to cool compared with@ their enormous volume that their cooling rate could have been slow enough to allow@ them to sustain more continuous@ activity than smaller living reptiles
3424,it has also been argued that the small mouths of the giants@ simply could not have downed enough food to support@ a warm-blooded metabolism particularly plant food that needs a lot of processing before it becomes available as energy
3425,the armoured@ or plated@ dinosaurs include some species that seem too heavily burdened with protective armour@ to have been very active but this@ does not necessarily mean that they had to be cold-blooded
3426,protagonists@ of the warm-blooded theory will show some of the horned dinosaurs charging over the cretaceous plains furious@ reptilian@ rhinoceroses@ 
3427,one idea about@ the life habits@ of the dinosaur giants@ published in@ in@ #
3428,the warm-blooded@ supporters tend@ to ally themselves with@ the supporters of a theory about@ the relationships of the dinosaurs
3429,this@ is that the dinosaurs or a close@ dinosaur relative included the ancestors of the living birds
3430,some of the smaller and most certainly highly active dinosaurs were about@ the size of a chicken and there is more than a passing@ similarity between@ a running ostrich and the kind of reconstruction@ that shows@ fleet-footed running dinosaurs
3431,the point@ is that birds themselves are warm-blooded like mammals and if birds and dinosaurs are as closely@ related as now seems likely then it obviously increases the likelihood that the dinosaurs themselves may have been warm-blooded
3432,the pros@ and cons@ of this@ theory are the subject@ of much contentious debate by experts but it would probably be correct to say@ that the greater@ number of specialists believe that at least the more bipedal of the dinosaurs including small and large carnivores were warm-blooded active animals
3433,a lot@ of the argument among@ the authorities on@ these@ animals is about@ the equivalence or otherwise of certain bones in dinosaurs and bird skeletons and particularly the jurassic bird this@ makes@ for rather dry@ reading for the layman@ 
3434,but the end-@ product@ is the accurate@ reconstruction@ of the jurassic and cretaceous terrestrial world@ over@ which the dinosaurs were indisputably dominant

3463,the police force face@ the virtually impossible task of keeping@ the lid@ on@ the explosive@ mixture@ of ingredients@ that the dynamics@ of british society have assembled@ in the inner city
3464,this@ mixture@ heated@ by recession and high@ unemployment inevitably generates@ a high@ level@ of crime
3465,this@ necessitates in@ turn@ a far@ more numerous and ubiquitous police presence than in other kinds of area far@ more frequent unpleasant contact@ with@ the public as potential suspects and far@ greater@ opportunities for police misjudgment or abuse
3466,the inevitable sufferers of course are the poor of whom those@ who actually commit@ the offences that concern the police are a tiny@ minority and whom indeed it should be the purpose of the police to protect
3467,not only are the most disadvantaged on@ the receiving@ end@ of most crime argues harrison they also have to put up with@ the heaviest@ police presence
3468,they are more likely to be stopped and searched and to be the victim@ of mistaken arrest or conviction
3469,at@ the same time the residents of the poorest areas have to suffer@ in@ a way@ that is not true of those@ who live elsewhere a growing@ fear of attack on@ themselves or their property
3470,improved police methods might help@ writes harrison to contain@ the problem
3471,but without@ other changes the result is likely to be a society of barricaded@ self-defence and a steady@ erosion@ of civil liberties@ 
3472,and he concludes of all the warnings that the inner city has to offer@ for the direction@ british society is taking@ this@ is perhaps the most sinister
3473,harrison's vision@ of a nightmarish future for inner cities locked@ in a cold@ or hot@ war between@ have-nots and the forces@ of public order@ was echoed by robert chesshyre # p # who concluded that by@ the late #

3504,leech and amin # p # summarize this@ approach@ not unfairly in@ the following@ terms
3505,the encouragement of private investment and the liberation@ of the market@ the containment of the forces@ of social discontent the control@ of the powers@ of the local authorities and the encouragement of the movement of the wealthy into the inner city thus creating buffer@ areas of tory support@ accentuating@ inequalities and injustice and hopefully though not necessarily reducing@ the potential for conflict among@ the urban poor
3506,the main thrust@ of the government's policy is contained@ in@ the january # white paper on@ regional policy and the enterprise economy in@ the new employment training@ programme and especially in@ the march # programme all resting@ on@ wider@ reforms to@ local government structure@ and finance and to@ education and housing
3507,the most striking feature@ of this@ package@ apart from its aim@ actively to involve employers and entrepreneurs is a sharp@ reduction@ in@ the role@ of local government
3508,despite the contemporary tone@ of much of the programme's heritage can be traced@ to@ the early # studies which provided the basis for the # milnerholland report on@ housing and the # plowden report on@ education as a result of which general improvement areas and education priority areas were established
3509,the # urban programme had@ a social rather than economic emphasis@ and was administered@ by the homeoffice
3510,it was initiated partly in response to the furore caused by enoch powell's # rivers of blood speech much as disturbances at@ the # notting hill carnival prompted@ further steps@ on the part of the department of the environment a riot makes@ a much bigger@ impact@ on@ government thinking as donnison # has pointed@ out@ than any amount of earnest@ and accurate@ research
3511,the urban programme consisted of grants and initiatives under@ the # local government grants social need act which was intended as a flexible@ instrument@ to provide supplementary help to@ local authorities in@ the fields@ of housing education and health
3512,originally the programme supplemented existing central@ and local government schemes designed@ to meet@ special needs in urban areas
3513,the scope was extended@ in@ an enhanced urban programme which included economic and environmental as well as social projects and was specifically directed@ at@ the inner urban areas where the problems were most severe@ 
3514,earlier the change of emphasis@ from@ a social to@ an economic and environmental focus@ had been reflected@ in@ a switch@ of responsibility for the programme from@ the homeoffice to@ the department of the environment
3515,the enhanced programme resulted from@ the # inner urban areas act based@ on@ a white paper published the previous year on@ doe # the first comprehensive policy statement on@ the subject@ to acknowledge it as a definable@ and cohesive problem
3516,the white paper drew@ on@ studies conducted@ earlier in@ the decade in liverpool birmingham and london which pointed@ to@ a debilitating@ flight@ of capital and skilled labour from the critical areas of deprivation
3517,a key aspect@ of the # white paper was the stress@ it placed@ on@ the wider@ effects of poverty that it was not just those@ with@ acute needs who suffered
3518,it argued@ that in@ talking about@ inner cities it was vital@ to think in termsnot just of individuals but of society that the multiple deprivations of the worst hit@ areas affected all the residents that the consequences included a pervasive sense@ of neglect and decay@ a decline in@ community spirit@ a low@ standard@ of neighbourhood facilities and an increase in@ crime and vandalism and that without@ government intervention the future was one of reduced@ job opportunities deteriorating housing and a decline in@ public services
3519,the document and the legislation that derived@ from@ it pointed@ to@ a positively discriminatory approach@ with@ both central@ and local government supplementing existing programmes in@ such a way@ as to strengthen@ local economies as well as the physical and socialenvironment@ 
3520,such measures@ constituted@ the present government's heritage when it took@ office@ in@ #
3521,none of them of course anticipated the scale@ of the problems which were caused by the slump and collapse@ of much of what remained@ of inner urban manufacturing industry in@ the early #
3522,neither at first did the incoming@ administration foresee@ the impact@ of rising@ unemployment which was to be especially serious@ among@ the urban young
3523,true the new secretary of state for the environment laid@ stress@ from@ the outset on@ the need for economicregeneration@ and indicated@ his sympathy for the voluntary in@ the tackling@ of urban problems
3524,the previous government however had already pointed@ to@ the need to revitalize@ urban economies and at first the shift was more rhetorical than real
3525,michael heseltine # p # has since claimed that we set@ a new@ objective to make the inner cities places where people would want to live and work and where the private investor would be willing to put@ his money
3526,became his slogan the partnership@ of public and private brains and money
3527,a new urban development grant was devised to pump-prime with@ public funds schemes which would then attract@ private investment
3528,heseltine's vision@ was of partnerships which recognise@ that there are some things@ that only governments can pay@ for but also that the ingenuity and flexibility@ of the private sector@ is indispensable p #
3529,he claims that serious@ work on@ inner-city policy began in@ # but it was undoubtedly the riots of # coinciding with@ the biggest@ drop@ in@ employment and job vacancies since the war which gave@ impetus@ to@ the new@ approach@ 
3530,urban development corporations were introduced in@ # in london docklands and merseyside and the urban development grant came@ in@ late the following@ year
3531,conservative instincts were of course to minimize@ within@ the partnership@ state involvement and expenditure relative to that@ of private enterprise
3532,yet the irony of the early # as a deteriorating but perennial urban problem rapidly became the most acute aspect@ of the crisis@ of mass unemployment was that a tory government willy-nilly found@ itself presiding over@ an increase in@ state intervention through@ a variety@ of agencies
3533,the increased scale@ of operations@ also ushered@ in@ another fashion of the # new@ management structures@ 
3534,thus in@ # city action teams were introduced to@ each inner city partnership area to co-ordinate@ the work of the three government departments involved
3535,task forces@ meanwhile were directed@ to tackle@ youth unemployment
3536,by@ # # the urban programme was supporting@ # starter units and # business starts in@ enterprise workshops@ 
3537,it was providing # training@ places@ often in conjunction with the manpower services commission some # buildings were being improved estate action aimed@ to tackle@ run down housing and a large@ number of new@ partnerships which some might see@ as subsidies or discredited@ regional grants in@ a new@ guise were in@ operation@ in@ an effort to bring@ private investment to@ run-down urban areas
3538,by@ # it was claimed that # million of urban development grant and urbanregeneration@ grant had successfully levered@ more than # million of private investment into@ the inner cities although how much of the latter sum might have been invested in@ any case is difficult to say@ 
3539,meanwhile there were other incentive schemes enterprise zones for example and simplified planning zones which aimed@ to lift@ tax and planning barriers@ in order to facilitate investment
3540,indeed while with@ one hand@ trying to hold@ down@ expenditure by local authorities the government found@ itself by@ the late # involved with@ the other hand@ in@ massive@ ear-marked spending on@ inner urban areas
3541,the department of the environment alone by@ # was spending@ half@ a billion pounds out of an action for cities total involving most home@ departments estimated at@ # billion
3542,perhaps a labour government would have spent@ even more it would certainly have spent@ it in@ different ways@ 
3543,it is a curious@ comment on@ thatcherism however that the administration most committed@ to@ a reduction@ in@ the role@ of the state and in@ the need for an independent@ private sector@ has spent@ more on@ urbanregeneration@ and employment schemes and incentives to@ private investment in@ urban areas than any other in@ recent history
3544,one of the most bizarre aspects@ of government policy has been the effective murder@ of the voluntary sector@ and its appropriation@ bysubterfuge into@ the tory version@ of the corporate state
3545,conservatives have always lauded the voluntarist principle in@ welfare and encouraged@ it from@ platforms@ 
3546,faced@ however with@ the catastrophic@ increase in@ unemployment and the need to occupy@ large@ numbers of workless people without@ directly@ employing them which would have run@ counter@ to@ the economic doctrine which had led@ to@ the redundancy of many of them in@ the first place@ the government poured@ money into@ any voluntary agency willing@ to put@ in@ a bid for government-funded cheap labour
3547,one result was the triumphant@ expansion@ of some charitable@ organizations which rejoiced@ both at@ their new-found importance and at@ the government's munificence
3548,another was the transformation of many such bodies@ already heavily@ subsidized from@ public funds into@ agencies of the state which financed@ them and indirectly determined@ their policy
3549,nowhere was the impact@ of this@ clumsy@ sleight@ of hand@ more evident than in the inner cities where voluntary organizations had been most active and where the government was most anxious@ for them to mop@ up@ unemployment
3550,however the later withdrawal@ of government support@ with@ the scrapping@ of the community programme as unemployment receded@ left@ many of these@ voluntary organizations high@ and dry@ 
3551,the national council for voluntary organizations ncvo has suggested@ from@ a recent survey@ that around@ # projects had been affected and had lost@ # million in@ funding macgregor #
3552,there was of course a crucial element@ in@ the government's anxiety@ the high@ concentration of ethnic minorities in the areas of concern
3553,in@ # nearly # per cent of ethnic minorities in the uk lived in@ partnership or programme areas
3554,there is a danger@ in@ reading back@ from@ this@ figureanother stereotype similar to@ the pavlovian drug addiction inner city assumed@ link@ 
3555,some urban areas have@ serious@ problems without@ a major ethnic dimension@ newcastle teesside not all members@ of ethnic minorities are poor or deprived
3556,nevertheless the high proportion of inner urban populations composed of people from ethnic minorities and the high incidence among these groups of all the indices of poverty and social and environmental hardship combined with the specific problem of inter-racial rivalry harassment and tension make race and ethnicity an aspect that is central to any analysis of the inner cities and of any ameliorative approach
3557,making@ sense@ of the # riots
3558,reactions@ to@ the riots have concentrated@ on@ a number@ of key variables that are said to characterize the localities in which the riots have occurred
3559,lord scarman's report on@ the # disorders@ highlighted@ the importance of unemployment urban deprivation racial disadvantage relations between@ young blacks and the police the decline of civic consent and political exclusion as the key issues
3560,other reactions@ have concentrated@ on@ the issue of the interplay@ between@ inner-city decay@ and racial disadvantage in contemporary britain
3561,yet others have argued that the unrest can be seen@ as a symptom@ of the breakdown@ of law and order@ in@ british society gaffney # hall # keith #
3562,the main issues that were prominent@ in@ debates during ## were race and law and order@ 
3563,this@ was by no means an accident since throughout@ the # a powerful@ body@ of media political and academic opinion had been constructed@ around@ the theme of how britain was drifting@ into@ a violent society and how the basis of consent was being shifted@ bythe pressures@ of immigration and the growth@ of multi-racial inner city areas
3564,a glimpse@ of the impact@ of the ## riots at@ this@ level@ can be achieved through@ two important debates in@ parliament
3565,the first took@ place@ in@ the midst@ of the july # riots and had@ as its theme civil disturbances
3566,the tone@ of the debate was set@ byhome secretary william whitelaw's introductory statement in@ which he spoke of a the need to remove@ the scourge@ of criminal violence from@ our streets and b the urgency of developingpolicies designed@ to promote@ the mutual tolerance and understanding upon@ which the whole@ future of a free democratic society depends vol # # july # col #
3567,the scourge@ of criminal violence was whitelaw argued a danger to@ the whole@ framework@ of consent and legality on@ which the political institutions of british society were based@ 
3568,in@ reply roy hattersley supported@ the call@ for the immediate suppression@ of street violence but warned that the roots@ of such riots could not be dealt with until all people felt@ they had@ a stake@ in@ british society ibid cols ##
3569,the second debate took@ place@ on@ # november # on@ the publication of the scarman report and had@ as its theme law and order@ 
3570,the importance of the riots in@ pushing@ the law and order@ issue and specifically policing on to@ the main political agenda was emphasized@ by the liberal leader david steel who argued that urgent action to prevent a drift@ into@ lawlessness was necessary from@ both a moral and a political perspective@ vol # # november # cols ##
3571,a subsequent debate on@ the same issue in@ march # was also full@ of references to@ the experience of # the impact@ of street violence crime decaying@ urban conditions the breakdown@ of consent between@ the police and many local communities and the spectre@ of more violence to come if changes in@ both policing tactics@ and social policy were not swiftly@ introduced vol # # march # cols ##
3572,the need to support@ the police was accepted by both the labour and the conservative speakers in@ the parliamentary debate on@ the riots and was established as a benchmark for the official response@ to@ the riots long@ before@ the scarman report was published in@ november #
3573,any substantive disagreement centred@ around@ the issue of what role@ social deprivation and unemployment had@ in@ bringing@ young people to protest violently on the streets
3574,intermingled with@ the discourses about@ race and law and order@ were constant@ references to@ unemployment particularly among@ the young and various forms@ of social disadvantage and poverty solomos # pp ##
3575,throughout@ # and # debates about@ the riots in@ the media in@ parliament and in@ various official reports hinged@ around@ the interrelationship between@ racial law-and-order and social factors@ 
3576,the importance of this@ debate can be explained partly bythe political capital@ which the opposition could make@ from@ linking@ the social and economic malaise@ of the country at large with@ violent street disturbances
3577,conversely throughout@ this@ period government ministers strenuously denied that unemployment and social deprivation were significant causes of urban unrest
3578,although the scarman report is often taken@ to be the central@ text which argues@ for a link@ between@ social conditions and disorder@ the terms of the debate were by no means set@ by scarman
3579,during both april and july # vigorous@ exchanges@ took@ place@ in@ the press and in@ parliament about@ the role@ that deteriorating social conditions and unemployment may have played@ in@ bringing about the riots
3580,during the # july parliamentary debate on@ civil disturbances roy hattersley's formulation@ of this@ linkage@ provided a useful summary of the social conditions argument
3581,after@ some preliminary remarks about@ the labour party's support@ for the police he went on to outline@ his opposition to@ the view@ of the riots as essentially anti-police outbursts
3582,i repeat that l do not believe that the principal cause of last week's riots was the conduct of the police
3583,it was the conditions of deprivation and despair in the decaying@ areas of our old cities areas in which the brixton and toxteth riots took@ place@ and areas from which the skinhead invaders@ of southall come
3584, vol # # july # col #
3585,much of the subsequent controversy about@ this@ analysis centred@ on@ the question of youth unemployment
3586,hattersley had suggested that the riots were a direct@ product@ of high levels@ of youth unemployment and a furious debate ensued in@ both parliament and the media about@ this@ assertion
3587,the final symbolic cue@ usedto make@ sense@ of the ## protests is more difficult to categorize but its basic meaning can be captured@ bythe term political marginality
3588,while a number@ of discussions of the roots@ of urban unrest in the united states have noted@ the salience of political marginality in@ determining participation in@ violent protests skolnick # fogelson # edelman # knopf # this@ issue has received@ relatively little attention in britain
3589,nevertheless during the ## events and their aftermath the political context@ was discussed from@ a number@ of perspectives@ 
3590,the scarman report for example located@ part@ of the explanation for the riots in@ the feelings of alienation and powerlessness@ which were experienced by young blacks living in depressed@ inner-city areas
3591,a successful policy for tackling@ the roots@ of urban disorder@ was seen@ as one which sought@ to involve all the community in@ dealing with the problems of each area so that they could come@ to feel@ that they have@ a stake@ in@ its future scarman # para #
3592,where@ such arguments did not fit in with@ the overarching themes of race violence and disorder@ and social deprivation they were either sidelined@ or pushed@ into@ the sub-clauses of official reports
3593,the scarman report for example contained@ the following policy proposal i recommend that local communities must be fully and effectively involved in@ planning@ in@ the provision of local services and in@ the management and financing of specific projects scarman # para #
3594,such a move@ towards@ greater@ political integration was seen@ by lord scarman as essential if the gap@ between@ inner-city residents and the forces@ of law and order@ was to be bridged@ 
3595,but the concern with@ overcoming@ political marginality remained@ on@ the sidelines@ of the main public debate because it questioned@ the perception of the rioters as driven@ byirrational uncivilized and criminal instincts
3596,this@ did not however stop@ the question of political marginality and the need to reform existing policies from@ being raised@ at all as can be seen@ subsequently bythe attempts after@ # to introduce both locally and nationally measures@ which were meant to address@ some of the grievances of the rioters and to ensure that further disturbances did not occur
3597,aspects@ of these@ measures@ are considered further@ on@ in@ the chapter
3598,perspectives@ on@ the # riots
3599,despite widespread predictions of further unrest in@ the aftermath of # the scale@ and the location of the # riots seem to have surprised even some of the most astute commentators
3600,handsworth for example was presented@ even shortly before@ september # as a success story in terms of police community relations
3601,the outbreak of violence in this@ area was therefore widely presented@ as an aberration
3602,similarly the spread@ of violence in london to areas such as the broadwater farm estate in tottenham was seen@ as a break@ from@ previous experience which had centred@ on@ areas such as brixton
3603,there are many continuities@ between@ ## and # in relation to the common-sense images@ usedin@ the press and television to cover@ the events
3604,but responses@ in@ # were different at least in terms of degree@ and probably in relation to the extent@ to@ which the riots were seen@ as a race phenomenon bya wider@ body@ of opinion
3605,the ambiguities and sub-clauses to be found@ in@ much of the press coverage during ## had at least acted@ as a countervailing tendency against@ the more extreme forms@ of discourse which blamed@ the riots completely on@ black people
3606,during the # riots and their immediate aftermath the imagery@ of race was used@ bysections@ of the press without@ the sense@ of ambiguity which could still be found@ in@ ##
3607,the silence over@ race was breached@ in@ ## but in@ # debate about@ racial issues was taken@ a step@ further@ 
3608,peregrine worsthorne for example usedthe ferocity of the confrontations in handsworth brixton and tottenham to argue that there was a major question@ mark@ over@ the possibility of assimilating the coloured@ population into@ mainstream british values sunday telegraph # september #
3609,to be sure there was still a strong@ response@ opposing enoch powell's call@ for repatriation from@ all shades@ of political opinion but the racialization of public debate about@ the # riots went@ much further@ than ##
3610,in@ this context@ it was the externality@ of british afro-caribbeans and asians which was highlighted@ rather the racist institutions and processes which worked@ against@ blacks at@ all levels@ of society
3611,the usage of race during the september-october # period took@ on@ new meanings which had@ little if anything to do@ with@ the impact@ of racism as such since the emphasis@ was on@ the cultural characteristics of the minority communities themselves
3612,after@ handsworth part@ of the press response@ was to blame the riot on@ rivalry between@ west indians and asians and even after@ the arguments were criticized by local residents and community leaders they were usedto explain' what happened
3613,in addition the question whether the cultures and values of the black communities their family structures@ and their political attitudes@ bred@ violence was constantly raised@ van dijk # 
3614,the actual facts' of who was arrested during the riots whether black or white were hardly debated since it was assumed@ that they were mostly black and mostly unemployed and involved with@ crime keith #
3615,the imagery@ of the black bomber usedin@ handsworth was extended@ to@ the notion that there were groups of alienated and criminalized young blacks who saw@ the riots as a chance to engage@ in@ an orgy@ of looting
3616,the dear report on@ handsworth captures@ this@ image@ and links@ it to@ the social condition of young blacks
3617,the majority of rioters who took@ part in@ these@ unhappy@ events were young black and afro-caribbean origin@ 
3618,let@ there be no doubt these@ young criminals are not in@ any way@ representative of the vast@ majority of the afro-caribbean community whose life has contributed@ to@ the life and culture of the west midlands over@ many years and whose hopes and aspirations are at@ one@ with@ those@ of every other law-abiding citizen
3619,we share@ a common sorrow@ 
3620,it is the duty of us all to ensure that an entire cultural group is not tainted@ bythe actions of a criminal minority
3621,dear # p #
3622,this@ black criminal minority was constructed@ not only into@ the leading force@ behind the riots but sometimes as the force
3623,indeed throughout@ september and october # and during the following months the imagery@ of race continued@ to dominate@ debate about@ both the causes and the policy outcomes of the riots
3624,as pointed@ out@ earlier the social causes argument was another major plank@ of public debate about@ the ## riots particularly in relation to the highly politicized issue of unemployment
3625,during # this@ issue was raised@ once again though by@ then the extent@ of mass unemployment and urban de-industrialization and decay@ was more stark@ than it had been in@ #l
3626,images@ of urban decay@ tinderbox@ cities and ghetto@ streets linked@ up@ with@ the images@ of race inequality and black@ ghettos@ to produce@ an analysis more complex but also more contradictory

3628,the described@ the estate as living@ hell@ and quoted@ one resident as saying that you've@ no idea how awful daily life is # october #
3629,such images@ were reworkings of arguments already usedabout@ toxteth in@ # and brixton in@ # but they were used more widely than in@ ##

3631,a number@ of stories using such imagery@ were run@ byboth the quality and the popular press during this@ period but similar arguments are to be found@ in@ parliamentary debates vol # # october # cols #-# # and even in@ official reports produced by the police on@ the riots in birmingham and london
3632,the cities of inner@ despair were conceived@ as the breeding@ ground@ for disorderly@ protest and however hard@ the government tried to break@ the causal link@ between@ the two@ it was forced@ to take@ on board@ the need to restore@ order@ not only through@ the police but through@ promises of help for the inner cities
3633,much as in@ ## the social causes argument cannot be seen@ separately@ from@ the broader@ debate about@ the future of the british economy and society
3634,the government's record on@ unemployment was a heavily@ politicized issue and just as in@ # it vehemently denied@ any responsibility for the riots through@ its pursuit@ of free-market@ policies
3635,but the government did find@ a way@ of accepting a link@ between@ the riots and social problems without@ bringing@ its main policies into@ the debate namely bylinking@ the growth@ of violent disorder@ to@ crime and drugs
3636,the emphasis@ on@ crime and the criminal acts@ of the rioters in@ the official responses@ to@ the # riots took@ a general and a specific form@ 
3637,the general form@ relied@ on@ the argument that the riots were not a form@ of protest against@ the insufferable social conditions of inner-city areas or the actions of the police but a criminal act@ or a cry@ for loot@ 
3638,this@ was an argument put@ most succinctly by geoffrey dear chief constable of the west midlands dear # and by douglas hurd the home secretary in relation to handsworth
3639,but it recurred as a theme in@ official and press responses@ to@ the other riots
3640,the specific form@ was built@ upon@ the notion that the outbreak of violence in handsworth and brixton in particular was brought about bydrug barons who saw@ the police attempting to curb their activities and control their territory
3641,numerous examples of this@ line@ of argument can be found@ in@ dear's report on@ handsworth and in@ press coverage during the riots
3642,taking@ the specific argument about@ the role@ of drugs and drug barons in@ stimulating the riots this@ seems to have served@ two purposes
3643,first it distanced@ the riots from@ the social economic political and other grievances@ which had been linked@ to@ them bylocating@ the cause outside@ the social problems of inner-city dwellers and in@ the simple greed of the drug barons@ to accumulate loot@ 
3644,second just as dear's image@ of a few hundred young black criminals was usedto explain what happened in handsworth the problem of drugs was used to explain what happened at@ a national level@ 
3645,the issue of drugs provided an everyday image@ already a national issue through@ saturation@ media coverage and public debate around@ which the police the homeoffice and other institutions could depoliticize@ the riots
3646,responding to@ the handsworth events douglas hurd was moved@ to argue forcibly@ that such events were senseless@ and reflected@ more on@ those who participated in@ them than on@ the society in@ which they took@ place@ the sound which law abiding people in handsworth heard on@ monday night the echoes@ of which i picked@ up@ on@ tuesday was not a cry@ for help but a cry@ for loot@ # september #
3647,the chief constable for the west midlands geoffrey dear took@ this@ argument further@ bypointing@ out@ that the day before@ the riots a successful carnival had taken@ place@ with@ the support@ of local community leaders
3648,he drew@ the conclusion from@ this@ that the riot came@ like a bolt@ out of@ the blue@ # november #
3649,such language focused@ attention on@ the individuals or groups who were breaking@ the law committing@ criminal acts and threatening@ the interests of the law-abiding majority
3650,part # sociology and crime
3651,explaining crime theories of criminality
3652,most people have@ their own notions or theories as to what causes criminal behaviour
3653,for example lack of discipline in@ the home genetic defects poverty mixing@ with the wrong sort have all been proposed as causes of criminality
3654,while such notions may all contains@ some elements@ of truth they are by no means complete explanations of criminal behaviour
3655,this@ chapter will examine@ a range@ of theories which attempt@ to explain such behaviour
3656,although the major theoretical explanations are covered@ in@ the numerous introductions@ to@ the sociology of crime and deviance and to@ sociology generally some review of these theories is necessary before embarking@ upon@ an examination of specific substantive examples of criminal behaviour
3657,as this@ is not a book on@ criminological theories what follows@ will be a brief@ overview of a wide@ range@ of theories and explanations
3658,first a word of warning might be in@ order@ 
3659,it would be naive to expect to uncover@ any ultimate explanation or basic cause for criminal behaviour given the extensive@ and diverse behaviour that is encompassed@ by the term crime
3660,suppose for example that it could be proved that one cause of delinquency was lack of parental supervision
3661,it might still be necessary to ask why delinquency occurred with one son or daughter but not another
3662,also there would be the further question of why the parents had not provided adequate supervision
3663,perhaps this@ was because of their poor@ living conditions which would raise@ the question of why they were in@ poor@ housing
3664,was this@ because of governmental housing policy or a poor@ employment record on the part of the bread-winner of the family
3665,clearly@ we are getting@ further@ and further@ away from@ the causes of delinquent behaviour and it is perhaps wisest to think in terms of causal processes when looking@ at@ criminal behaviour
3666,biological and psychological theories
3667,before examining the major sociological on@ crime it is useful to refer to@ theories from@ outside of@ sociology from@ other academic disciplines
3668,thus we will look@ initially at@ biological and psychological theories
3669,biological theories
3670,biological or physiological explanations are based@ on@ the notion that some individuals are predisposed to@ criminal behaviour because of their genetic make-up@ 
3671,the individual criminal is born so and this@ is usually put@ down@ to@ faulty chromosome patterns@ or more vaguely to hereditary@ traits
3672,the most famous exponent of this@ approach@ was the nineteenth-century italian physician 
3673,in@ his book lombroso developed a complex description of what he called@ the born criminal who could be recognised bya variety of physical characteristics in@ particular facial characteristics for example large jaws and ears and high cheek bones
3674,in the medical faculty at the university of rome there is a gallery of portraits of splendidly ugly delinquents who were used to illustrate@ lombroso's theory
3675,to use his own language
3676,thus were explained anatomically the enormous jaws high cheek bones prominent superciliary arches@ solitary@ lines on the palms extreme size of the orbits@ handle@ or sessile@ ears found@ in@ criminals savages@ and apes insensibility of pain extremely acute@ sight tattooing excessive idleness love of orgies and the craving for evil for its own sake
3677,these@ explanations see@ the delinquent individual as inherently more prone@ to@ criminal behaviour than the non-delinquent
3678,they have been widely criticised and rejected by sociologists
3679,lombroso's work for example was based@ on@ his examination of people in prison in italy
3680,this@ would necessarily ignore@ the fact that many criminals do not go to prison and that perhaps people in prison are not always criminal
3681,most advocates@ of biological theories do not express@ themselves in@ the same bizarre language and style as lombroso and such theories of crime are not merely historical relics@ that died@ with@ lombroso
3682,in@ a major study of institutionalised delinquents delinquents in@ some form@ of custody in the usa in@ the # found@ that delinquent boys were twice as likely to have a mesomorphic build a chunky muscular compared with@ non-delinquent boys
3683,however the fact that the study was restricted@ to@ institutionalised delinquents limits the validity of the association@ between@ body build and crime and delinquency
3684,it may be that tougher@ delinquents are more liable to@ be put@ away@ than fragile@ looking ones
3685,furthermore it has been found@ that the association@ between@ delinquency on@ the one hand@ and height weight and physique on@ the other@ is greatly reduced@ once social background@ factors are taken@ into@ account@ 
3686,for example lower@ working-class people are more likely to be mesomorphic as a result of their diet and continual manual labour and this@ class grouping is more likely to be found@ represented in@ the criminal statistics
3687,with regard to the links@ between@ criminal behaviour and inherited@ characteristics there have been a number of theoretical explanations suggesting@ an association@ between@ criminality and particular personality characteristics
3688,an example of this@ more sophisticated@ biological approach@ is the work of hans eysenck who has argued in@ a series of studies that there is a link@ between@ genetically based personality characteristics and criminal behaviour
3689,he maintains@ that there is a link@ between@ characteristics such as extroversion and criminal behaviour
3690,an individual's degree@ of extroversion or introversion is inherited@ determined@ byhis or her genetic make-up@ 
3691,the link@ with@ crime found@ by eysenck was that when prisoners were tested for extroversion more extroverts were found@ than in@ the general population
3692,eysenck then argues that extroversion is the inherited@ basis of criminal behaviour
3693,extroverts take@ longer to learn the rules@ of society they are more likely to break@ them@ and thus more likely become convicted criminals
3694,as with@ lombroso's work and the gluecks' study discussed above@ bystarting with@ institutionalised criminals it is assumed@ that all prisoners are criminals and that most criminals do in@ fact go to prison
3695,the people who get caught and imprisoned may not be a representative picture@ of all criminals
3696,the major problem faced@ bytheories suggesting@ a link@ between@ genetic make-up@ and criminal behaviour is the difficulty of distinguishing between@ genetic and environmental effects
3697,while some genetic influence cannot be ruled out just what is inherited@ remains very unclear
3698,psychological theories
3699,these@ theories share@ certain similarities with@ biological explanations
3700,they stress@ the link@ between@ criminal behaviour and specific personality traits or characteristics
3701,psychological theories however see@ these@ characteristics as a result of unusual or abnormal experiences rather than as inherited@ 
3702,thus as with@ biological theories crime is seen@ as pathological a disease as something to be looked@ at@ from@ the medical point@ of view@ 
3703,however psychological causes are seen as treatable whereas biological causes mark@ the individual for life
3704,in@ those@ cases there is no possible treatment one is born a criminal
3705,many psychological theories refer@ to@ faulty parent-child relationships such as abnormal experiences in@ early childhood having@ a lasting effect and influence on@ personality
3706,studies in@ this@ area@ have indicated@ that too strict@ or too lax@ parental attitudes@ increase the risk of delinquency the work of john bowlby for example they have found@ that if a young child is deprived of close@ personal relationships with parents or parent figuresthen problem behaviour is more common
3707,it is well established that in@ the delinquent-prone home discipline is more liable to be too lax@ strict or erratic
3708,however it is patently obvious that parents can be a good or bad influence and example for their children and this@ fact can hardly be usedto explain@ present patterns@ of crime
3709,the majority of offenders do not come from disturbed@ or broken@ homes and many broken@ homes do not produce@ delinquents
3710,of course this@ last point@ does not show@ that there is link@ between@ parent-child relations and crime and delinquency
3711,the problem with@ assessing@ the influence of parental and family dimensions@ such as weak@ supervision or parental criminality is the fact that they are closely@ linked@ to@ various aspects@ of social and economic disadvantage such as poverty overcrowding and poor@ housing
3712,and it may be that these@ disadvantages help to cause parental difficulties and hamper@ good parenting
3713,we can hardly do justice to@ the wide@ scope of psychological theories here@ but there are some basic ideas and assumptions which underlie such theorizing
3714,these@ stress@ the importance of family relationships and upbringing during the early years and conclude@ that anti-social and byimplication criminal behaviour results from@ faulty personality development 
3715,to summarise these@ biological and psychological theories hold@ that the criminal is a particular type of person apart from the rest@ of society and with@ a special predisposition toward@ criminal behaviour
3716,they are based@ on@ the idea that criminal behaviour is either inherited@ or a consequence of unique individual experiences
3717,before we look@ at@ sociological explanations it might be useful to ask yourself or to discuss with colleagues whether you feel@ that criminals are different types of person
3718,while there are no doubt predispositions toward@ criminal behaviour and clearly certain characteristics are inherited@ most sociologists would reject these@ individual pathology sort of theories
3719,they lack convincing supporting@ evidence
3720,while some offenders suffer from@ mental disorders the vast@ majority do not
3721,furthermore if criminals are abnormal then it follows@ that a large@ proportion of the population must also be abnormal
3722,for numerous studies have shown@ that a high@ percentage of the population have committed criminal offences in@ particular high@ proportions of juveniles and it is difficult to believe that they are all different or abnormal
3723,sociological theories
3724,we said above@ that sociologists would reject non-sociological explanations of crime
3725,this@ is not because such explanations are wrong but because they are incomplete@ or inadequate
3726,in@ chapter one it was stressed@ that crime cannot be considered@ aside from its social context@ that it is dependent on@ society defining certain actions as criminal and on@ the reaction@ of others to@ such actions
3727,potential applications@ 
3728,overview
3729,ian masser
3730,given the extent@ to@ which geographic information management is applications@ driven it is important to consider@ in@ some depth@ the characteristics of some potential application@ fields@ 
3731,in@ the process it will be necessary to examine@ not only the extent@ to@ which geographic issues feature on@ the policy issues agenda in@ these@ fields@ but also the institutional context@ which governs@ decision-making and the extent@ to@ which data are available for research and policy analysis purposes
3732,questions@ on@ data availability are likely to be particularly important where users are heavily@ dependent on@ secondary sources@ 
3733,in@ situations@ of this@ kind provisions@ governing@ access@ and format@ may exert@ powerful@ constraints on@ the usethat can be made@ of these@ data
3734,the first four chapters in@ this@ part@ examine@ issues relating to@ geographic information handling@ in terms of four potential applications@ fields@ 
3735,the authors were asked to review the current state@ of the art@ in@ their fields@ with@ particular reference to@ the likely requirements of the future policy issues agenda in terms of the demands that they make@ on@ geographic information management
3736,authors were also asked to evaluate critically the state@ of geographic information provision in terms of the needs of users and to consider@ the impact@ of user requirements on@ the development of geographic information handling@ methodology
3737,in@ this@ way@ the chapters in@ this@ part@ present@ a number of perspectives@ which essentially complement and amplify@ the discussion@ in@ the previous part@ 
3738,in@ this@ case however methodological issues are tackled@ from@ a largely user standpoint whereas in@ the previous part@ they were viewed@ as substantive problems in@ their own right
3739,in@ effect the product@ of the discussion@ in@ both parts@ is a matrix@ where the methodological issues are listed@ along@ one axis@ and particular applications@ fields@ on@ the other@ 
3740,figure # summarizes@ the main features@ of this@ matrix
3741,there are important differences between@ the chapters in@ this@ part@ both in@ the nature@ of the demands that they make@ on@ geographic information and also in@ the relative importance that is attached@ to@ geographic criteria as against other issues by planners and decision-makers in@ these@ fields@ 
3742,the first three chapters dealing@ with@ environmental monitoring natural and technological hazards and settlements and infrastructure applications@ make@ use of a very wide@ range@ of geographic information
3743,a major feature@ of these@ applications@ is the extent@ to@ which they involve overlays@ of a variety of information drawn@ from@ different sources@ on@ a topographic map base@ 
3744,for this@ reason they make@ particularly heavy@ demands on@ current gis technology both because of the size@ of the data sets and the diversity of the data structures@ that are involved
3745,brown's chapter on@ geodemographics discusses@ an application@ field@ where@ primary data collected@ for operational purposes are typically evaluated in relation to secondary data derived@ from@ sources@ such as the census of population
3746,the range@ of data sets involved and the demands that are made@ on@ gis technology in@ applications@ of this@ kind are often more limited than those@ of previous applications@ fields@ 
3747,however this@ is offset bythe demands that are made@ on@ spatial analysis and modelling@ methodology
3748,rhind's chapter on@ environmental monitoring and prediction discusses@ the role@ of geographic information management in@ promoting sustainable development on@ a global scale@ in@ the context@ of the issues identified@ in@ the brundtland report
3749,it points@ to@ the impact@ that the findings of global environmental research are likely to have@ on@ most sectors@ of the uk economy
3750,this@ contribution@ also indicates@ the wide@ variety of groups that are involved in@ monitoring environmental change@ and draws@ attention to@ the role@ that the european community is increasingly playing@ in@ co-ordinating@ these@ efforts
3751,one of the examples of work in@ progress@ discusses@ research that has been carried out for the european commission as part@ of the corine project
3752,this@ highlights@ the challenges@ for research in@ a field@ categorized by a lack of data for some countries varying definitions and standards@ in@ use and unreasonably high@ user expectations
3753,the chapter as a whole draws@ attention to@ a number of key methodological issues that are involved in@ environmental monitoring and prediction
3754,these@ include@ the highly specialized nature@ of much of the technical analysis the limited capacity@ for checking the accuracy of many of the findings of this@ kind of research and the consequent need for the development of knowledge-based@ inference machines for extracting@ useful information from@ secondary and often proxy data
3755,in chapter # gatrell and vincent consider a wide range of natural and technological hazards including industrial hazards risk assessment hazardous waste disposal emergency planning natural hazards and environmental epidemiology
3756,the substantive content of much of this research straddles the social environmental and mathematical sciences
3757,to model the dispersal of a plume of toxic gas generated by a chemical explosion and its impact on the surrounding area for example an understanding of atmospheric dispersion models epidemiology and population distribution would be required
3758,in applications of this kind the authors argue that geographic information management in general and gis in particular have an important role to play and they give a number of examples from research in progress to illustrate the current state of the art in this field
3759,the discussion of operational problems and prospects further amplifies many of the issues raised in preceding chapters particularly with respect to the problems caused by the dependency on secondary data sources and the need for much more detailed geographic information to overcome some of the problems associated with linking data sets
3760,like most of the other contributors to this section gatrell and vincent see decision support systems as a major area for future development in the geographic information management field
3761,given that most gis are rather dumb systems requiring intelligent very computer literate users managing natural and technological hazards means that this knowledge base must be built into the system so that it can be utilized quickly by untrained users after a disaster has taken place or in an emergency
3762,the settlement and infrastructure field is also characterized by a wide range of users with a great diversity of interests
3763,these include not only central and local government but also major utility companies and transport suppliers
3764,according to shepherd these users share a common need for up-to-date information on the amount capacity and condition of urban land transport networks utilities hospitals schools and other major communal facilities
3765,in addition to these data requirements such users are also interested in developing their capabilities for modelling the changing relationships between the supply and demand for infrastructure in the context of both public and private sector decision-making
3766,shepherd more than any other contributor to this section draws attention to the extent to which current efforts in the geographic information management field are constrained by the highly fragmented nature of both data suppliers and users both in sectoral and spatial terms the great diversity of data sets in varying formats and the difficulties presented by institutional factors such as copyright provision data ownership and the control of access to data
3767,digital data occupy a central position in this applications field and a number of examples are given to illustrate the extent to which their development has been hampered or facilitated in various countries by the policies of the organizations with responsibility for digital data provision
3768,in chapter # brown reviews the development of geodemographics from its origins in the computer-based social area analysis of us census tract data from # onwards
3769,he describes the features of the four main systems that are currently in use in the uk and illustrates their application with reference to examples drawn from retail analysis and store location market research credit rating and target marketing
3770,brown demonstrates the extent to which the growth of research activities in this field has led to the emergence of improved cluster analytic methods for the multidimensional classification of people according to the type of area in which they live
3771,in the last part of this contribution brown identifies a number of priorities for future research
3772,like gatrell and vincent and shepherd before him he is concerned with the lack of detailed geographical information particularly in this case with reference to the years between censuses
3773,spatial linkages also feature prominently in brown's discussion which amplifies many of the points made in the earlier contribution from openshaw in chapter #
3774,the analysis points to the need for the development of a fuzzy geodemographics methodology which takes account of the effects of different types of spatial errors
3775,other major research priorities for the future in this applications field are the development of response-modelling techniques to explore the factors affecting consumer choice
3776,this is particularly important in a field where many of the demands made by users are highly specialized in nature
3777,in summary then as fig # shows many of the issues raised by this review of geographic information handling in the four potential application fields are essentially complementary to those discussed in the part on methodological developments
3778,spatial analysis features particularly prominent on the research agenda relating to natural and technological hazards and geodemographics
3779,questions relating to data integration emerge as being particularly critical in terms of environmental monitoring and settlement and infrastructure applications
3780,spatial linkages and questions relating to spatial representation feature prominently in the settlements and infrastructure and geodemographics fields
3781,the evaluation of error propagation is a matter of considerable significance in the environmental monitoring and settlements and infrastructure fields
3782,finally in all applications fields the findings of the reviews above suggest that there is a need for improvements in user interfaces of all kinds
3783,this is particularly evident in the demand for the development of knowledge-based decision support systems and modelling capabilities
3784,such demands highlight the extent to which geographic information management must be regarded as a means to an end rather than an end in itself when viewed from the standpoints of the needs of planners and decision-makers
3785,the final chapter in this section rounds off the discussion of applications-related research with an examination of organizational issues that need to be taken account of in handling geographic information
3786,campbell presents a conceptual framework for the analysis of the organizational issues involved in the development and implementation of gis
3787,this contribution cuts across many of the questions relating to particular applications that were raised in preceding chapters and draws attention to the dangers of neglecting institutional and personal considerations in practice
3788,all too often as the experience of many mature applications indicates technical and data-related matters dominate the system development phase and technically elegant solutions are devised which fail to take enough account of user needs and capabilities
3789,campbell discusses the role of geographic information in organizations and the process of gis diffusion drawing upon research from a variety of social science disciplines
3790,the findings of the analysis are summarized in two sets of research questions for all applications fields
3791,in this way she sets out a research agenda for applications-related research which serves a similar function to the spatial analysis research agenda set out by openshaw at the beginning of part two 
3792,environmental monitoring and prediction
3793,david rhind
3794,introduction
3795,monitoring of the state of and the changes in the environment is now universally recognized as being of profound importance to mankind tickell # #
3796,this awareness is most obviously manifested by the frequent appearance of press reports on ozone depletion on the greenhouse effect and possible global warming on nitrate pollution on deforestation in the tropics on decreasing biological diversity and on many other environmentally related topics
3797,usually these reports concentrate on prophecies of a forthcoming armageddon but many also describe a dire contemporary situation
3798,thus the algal bloom off the italian adriatic shore in # is reckoned to have caused the holiday trade and local fisherman losses running into tens if not hundreds of millions of pounds
3799,more globally the brundtland report wced # noted that in the # days during which the world commission was at work
3800,#
3801,the african drought put the lives of # million people at risk and may have killed # million of them
3802,#
3803,the bhopal accident killed # and injured # # more
3804,#
3805,the chernobyl disaster caused environmental damage across europe
3806,#
3807,a chemical fire in switzerland caused toxic materials to be transported by the rhine at least as far as the netherlands
3808,#
3809,at least # million people died of diarrhoeal diseases caused by malnutrition and dirty water
3810,as a consequence of these and other disasters of rapid and world-wide broadcasting of them and of the concerned action of many individuals the environment is now moving fast up the political agenda patten #
3811,the then prime minister also emphasized the political awakening to the environment in statements such as it is possible that with all these enormous changes population agricultural use of fossil fuels concentrated into such a short period of time we have unwittingly begun a massive experiment with the system of this planet itself thatcher #
3812,the political concern is not altruistic
3813,mrs thatcher a recent convert to environmental conservation clearly held the opinion that environmental problems are not only soluble but that solving them can be shown to be cost-effective
3814,in the past when we identified forms of pollution we have shown our capacity to act effectively
3815,the great london smogs are now only a nightmare of the past
3816,we have cut airborne lead by # per cent
3817,we are spending # billion on cleansing the mersey basin alone and the thames now has the cleanest metropolitan estuary in the world
3818,even though this kind of action may cost a lot i believe it to be money well and necessarily spent because the health of our economy and the health of our environment are totally dependent upon each other
3819,the government espouses the concept of sustainable economic development
3820,stable prosperity can be achieved throughout the world provided the environment is nurtured and safeguarded thatcher #
3821,the primary official manifestation of this uk commitment to the environment has been the government's white paper hmso #
3822,while criticized by many on the grounds that it had few teeth and represented a compromise between the doe and all other departments notably those of agriculture and of transport it was none the less a major achievement
3823,its main sections dealt with the government's approach to the environment nationally at the european level and globally the nature and effects of the greenhouse effect environmental problems in both rural and urban areas especially in relation to land-use matters pollution control and enhancing awareness of environmental matters
3824,central to this approach is said to be an emphasis upon guidance from the best available scientific evidence
3825,there is also a clear recognition of the need for monitoring and modelling of the state of the natural and man-influenced environment
3826,though there has been a change of prime minister and of the secretary of state for the environment since the publication of the white paper the environmental cause seems as strong as ever
3827,thus of # december # reported that a group of # of the most senior civil servants had met the previous weekend to discuss ways in which the government machine could respond better to national and international problems such as the threat of global climate change
3828,pearce # have argued that the effects of government commercial and other actions on the environment can and should be assessed on a cost benefit basis and this seems likely to be the basis on which at least the uk government will proceed
3829,given such a lead it is scarcely surprising that british scientists have sought to demonstrate the practical and financial consequences of environmental events and processes table # for example illustrates their perception of the importance of global environmental research to the uk domestic economy
3830,if it now seems self-evident that monitoring of the global environment is necessary indeed is even vital the prediction of what is likely to happen is almost as important the # # people in the maldives are understandably worried about the prospect of global sea-level change since no part of the islands is more than # m above present sea-level
3831,yet as we shall see below the prediction of the activities of natural and man-influenced environmental systems requires an understanding of the interaction of processes that in many cases we simply do not yet have
3832,even monitoring of the present is very imperfect as witness the order of magnitude variations in estimates now current for deforestation rates
3833,this chapter then attempts to review some of the problems in environmental monitoring and prediction describes some of the relevant scientific and organizational activities and looks ahead to what is likely to happen next
3834,the nature of environmental processes
3835,notwithstanding mrs thatcher's confidence that we can fix environmental problems the difficulties associated with a task even as apparently simple as monitoring a state variable are considerable
3836,some of the reasons for this the difficulty of deciding on appropriate proxy variables and on economical yet non-biasing temporal and spatial sampling frameworks taking account of the relative importance of aperiodic and rare events as compared to near-continuous processes processing the vast volumes of data usually involved and organizing the multidisciplinary and often multinational researchers involved are discussed briefly later
3837,even at this stage however it is important to stress that we have a very incomplete understanding of many processes in the natural environment
3838,the next section therefore attempts to summarize what we do know it is derived chiefly from the earth system sciences committee essc #
3839,temporal and spatial scales of operation
3840,even ignoring the effects of man earth system processes operate at a variety of spatial and temporal scales see fig # see also rosswall #
3841,thus microclimate effects can have major short-term implications for local populations such as those brought about by the photochemical smogs of los angeles are often applicable only over areas of a few hectares or less and may operate on a diurnal cycle
3842,in contrast soil creation cf soil degradation may require hundreds or thousands of years
3843,in between are variations in phenomena such as 
3844,the sampling theorem indicates that we must sample these phenomena at a frequency of no less than half their wavelength if we are to avoid bias in measurement
3845,in this chapter the primary concern is with changes occurring over time spans from minutes to centuries and from spatial wavelengths from about # m to about # km
3846,it is however impossible to separate out processes acting at different scales and over different periods a single volcanic eruption lasting hours or days sometimes leads to dust and gas being ejected into the atmosphere over a period of months and this in turn may lead to global climatic fluctuations over years or decades
3847,conversely a large-scale and long-period phenomenon such as the movement of tectonic plates can lead to local stress accumulation and to its release by an earthquake in a few seconds and with highly local effects
3848,this therefore has the following consequences
3849,#
3850,we should know something about the periodicity of the variables we are monitoring if we are not to risk either unnecessarily detailed data collection or aliasing of trends
3851,#
3852,since we know that the periodicity of some variables is longer than the monitoring already carried out by human beings we must make use of surrogate or proxy variables to extend our range of knowledge such as via tree rings palynology oxygen isotope ratios from ice cores and geomorphological evidence of environmental change
3853,#
3854,since we are not yet able to predict all the interactions which may be important in a study of environmental problems collecting potentially useful data as well as those believed central to the problem under study is often wise
3855,#
3856,we must accept that most data collection exercises will inevitably be a compromise on the grounds of cost and hence less than perfect data sets will be produced
3857,#
3858,irrespective of the use of surrogates monitoring environmental processes only makes sense over time-scales which are extended by human standards hence the igbp see below is designed to run for two or three decades
3859,#
3860,changes in political priorities may simply result in the need for informed guesswork if suitable data are not available
3861,much attention will be given throughout this chapter to monitoring the environment on a global basis
3862,this is not merely because of its topical nature
3863,the main reason is that though some problems are local and are best studied that way many others even involving a limited geographical extent are best understood within a global framework
3864,thus no meteorologist would attempt to forecast the weather # or # days ahead without using a mathematical model based on observations from all around the world
3865,moreover recent work has shown that much of the heat energy in the seas of the north atlantic every square kilometre of which gives off as much energy as a nuclear power station and hence influences our weather is absorbed from sunlight in the tropical pacific and is carried by ocean currents through the drake passage and up into the atlantic
3866,thus to understand some local and many regional national and continental and all global environmental events we need to have a global perspective and hold global databases rhind and mounsey # mounsey and tomlinson #
3867,in no way however does this invalidate the need for microscale studies for instance while global data sets may indicate the extent of algal blooms and may causes of them only detailed study of the algae themselves can provide understanding of why the bloom is occurring 
3868,the processes themselves
3869,a major complication however is that the environment can rarely be treated as in a laboratory experiment
3870,given this determining the nature of the interactions between the variables becomes a matter of major difficulty
3871,figure # is taken from essc # and is an attempt to show the interactions between environmental processes as well as the indicators and implications of change in the state of the environment
3872,in essence the figure can be summarized as showing processes within the physical climate system and within the biogeochemical one these systems being interwoven by the global role of water and increasingly affected by human activities
3873,the main components of the first system are well known the atmosphere is its engine and atmospheric circulation is driven by differences in solar heating between the equatorial and polar regions
3874,we are however becoming ever more aware of the massive influence of oceans on our climate research into ocean atmosphere interactions is now a priority
3875,in ocean dynamics studies important topics are heat storage circulation and the role of sea ice
3876,atmospheric circulation and in turn precipitation and temperature is also greatly affected by the balance of thermal energy at the land surface itself affected by the vegetation and terrain characteristics
3877,the biogeochemical system embraces the totality of the movements of the key elements essential to life carbon nitrogen oxygen phosphorus and others through what has been described as the total earth system
3878,the oceans and their biota play a central role in the carbon and nutrient cycles global ocean circulation is also critical to the global carbon budget
3879,trace gases in the atmosphere are key components of the cycles of such elements as carbon nitrogen oxygen sulphur and the halogens as is now well known their concentrations are much influenced by biogenic and anthropogenic activities and the concentrations of such gases as carbon dioxide ozone methane nitrous oxide and the chlorofluoromethanes cfms strongly affect radiative transfer and provide a link with the physical climate system
3880,a particular cause for concern is that the concentrations of the two main cfms is increasing by about # per cent per annum while the equivalent figures for methane nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide are # # and # per cent
3881,finally the chemistry of the stratosphere is dominated by the photochemical production and catalytic destruction of ozone
3882,there are several important ways in which biogeochemical processes can influence climate and hence habitability except where the latter is maintained at enormous cost
3883,if for instance the concentrations of certain trace gases see above continue to increase it has been predicted that the earth's surface temperature will increase by an amount comparable to that since the last major phase of the most recent glaciation about # # years bp though there is some dispute about the magnitude of the likely change
3884,the converse case the effect of physical climate changes on biogeochemical processes is also of obvious importance changes in annual averages and cycles of temperature and precipitation together with the probabilities of extreme events such as prolonged droughts or frosts are major determinants of terrestrial ecosystem type at least in areas largely unaffected by human activity
3885,human-induced changes to the environment have increased rapidly as a consequence of growing population numbers and of numerous developments in technology
3886,fossil fuel combustion for instance has led to increased concentrations of sulphate in precipitation acid rain' and many rivers lakes and estuaries have been greatly affected by phosphates from agricultural urban or industrial sources
3887,it should be stressed however that while the outlines of human activities are clear there are still many uncertainties for instance we know that the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has risen about # per cent since #
3888,but calculations of the total carbon released by fossil fuel combustion imply that if all such carbon remained in the atmosphere the concentration would have increased by twice as much
3889,the absolute difference between the two figures seems to be due to two different factors absorption by the oceans and other reductions in carbon stocks in living biota the latter being strongly affected by human activities since the industrial revolution
3890,does god play dice
3891,much environmental prediction is predicated upon a logical positivist or newtonian deterministic basis
3892,the environmental systems are effectively regarded as machines whose workings can all be discovered described in differential equation form and whose future activities can thus be predicted in detail if their initial states are known
3893,an argument by many atmospheric physicists for example is that shortcomings in the accuracy of weather prediction over periods of more than a few days largely results from the unsophisticated nature of existing models the lack of suitable data and inadequate computer power see fig # derived from tyler #
3894,in contrast the advocates of chaos theory eg stewart # argue that some natural systems are so sensitive to tiny stimuli that even the faint beat of a butterfly's wing could be the ultimate trigger for a hurricane
3895,in essence they argue that tiny differences in the initial conditions of many systems can lead to widely different outcomes since the systems exhibit stochastic behaviour within a deterministic framework
3896,if so there is little chance of making accurate long-term forecasts of these systems
3897,this has been recognized by among others essc #
3898,the authors of that report accepted that there is a theoretical limit of ## weeks in explicit prediction of day-to-day fluctuations in weather because of the influence of small-scale turbulence within the large-scale dynamics such limits imply that medium and long-term prediction must inevitably be stochastic
3899,to complicate matters still further however it seems at least possible that the components of the earth system may best be predicted deterministically at some spatial and temporal scales but stochastically at others and that the basis of prediction will differ for different components
3900,as an example atmospheric temperature shows marked day-to-day variability a strong seasonal cycle with some year-to-year variations a weak minimum variability for ## year averages and then increased variation again at longer time-scales essc #
3901,it need hardly be pointed out that coping with such multiple databases on which modelling is to be carried out is not a trivial exercise
3902,finally it is perhaps worth concluding this section by emphasizing that there is still much controversy among the scientific community about the magnitude of many of the effects being discussed
3903,in general the research work of the international groups of scientists including those involved in the inter-governmental committee and in the uk's inter-agency committee on global environmental change has progressively reduced the magnitude of the predicted effects of for example global warming
3904,in giving the # robens coal science lecture at the royal institution sir john mason a former director of the meteorological office urged caution in interpreting the results of the massive atmospheric and oceanic modelling exercises as the equilibrium models are refined to take account of the thermal lag in oceans etc lower values of predicted changes are likely
3905,thus while almost all scientists are at the time of writing convinced from the evidence that change in climate is under way and that regional effects may be much greater than the global average the magnitude of the latter is now thought likely to be about half of what was predicted only # years ago
3906,who is involved and what is going on
3907,if we consider the environment in the broadest sense much monitoring of it has been in progress for many years and by an enormous diversity of organizations in the uk these include the doe the forestry commission the nature conservancy the health and safety executive local authorities the component members of the natural environment research council such as the institute of terrestrial ecology and the british antarctic survey individuals or research groups in academia the cegb the friends of the earth and uk centre for economic and environmental development ceed #
3908,the diversity of monitoring organizations seems just as great in other countries numerous multinational organizations both quasi-governmental eg the un environment programme unep and non-governmental eg the international union for the conservation of nature iucn and the international institute for environment and development iied are also active in the field
3909,moreover commercial monitoring of the environment is now also routine notably to predict crop yields in the main grain-growing areas and hence facilitate the buying of futures
3910,the international scientific involvement
3911,scientists have both promoted and responded to the increasing interest in the environment
3912,thus at the global scale the international council of scientific unions icsu has endorsed the setting up of the international geosphere biosphere project igbp to describe and understand the interactive physical chemical and biological processes that regulate the total earth system the unique environment it provides for life the changes that are occurring in that system and the manner by which these changes are influenced by human actions report of planning group for igbp # quoted in igbp #
3913,priority in the igbp is intended to be given to those areas which deal with key interactions and significant changes on the time-scales of decades to centuries that most affect the biosphere that are most susceptible to human perturbations and those that will most likely lead to a practical predictive capability for global change
3914,this is to be put into operation by concentrating on four themes
3915,#
3916,documenting and predicting global change
3917,#
3918,observing and improving our understanding of dominant forcing functions
3919,#
3920,improving our understanding of interactive phenomena in the total earth system
3921,#
3922,assessing those effects of global change which will be large scale and cause major modifications to both renewable and non-renewable resources
3923,by # igbp had progressed as far as defining a set of seven core projects igbp # addressing these four themes
3924,in addition plans for regional research centres and for the data and information systems for igbp known as igbp-dis had been announced
3925,the latter are particularly relevant to this chapter
3926,based in paris and working under professor i rasool it is intended to concentrate on managerial and policy aspects of the task in the first # years ## but then to expand considerably thereafter
3927,tasks agreed for the igbp-dis include making available a directory of data directories modelled on nasa's master directory providing data sets for education and training and undertaking a land cover pilot study
3928,until # remarkably little interaction had taken place between the hard science and the social science communities on global monitoring and prediction
3929,it is noteworthy however that the royal society made a plea for just this type of multidisciplinary work in its submission on greenhouse gases to the house of lords' select committee on science and technology royal society # #
3930,fortunately in addition to the actions of the world hard science community a parallel effort is now being initiated by social scientists fuchs # jacobson and price #
3931,currently this is organized and sponsored by the international social science council issc the un university and the international federation of institutes of advanced studies
3932,its objectives are to
3933,#
3934,improve scientific understanding and increase awareness of the complex dynamics governing human interaction with the total earth system
3935,#
3936,study explore and anticipate social change affecting the global environment
3937,#
3938,identify broad social strategies to prevent or mitigate undesirable impacts of global change or to adapt to changes which are unavoidable
3939,#
3940,analyse policy options for dealing with global environmental change and promoting the goal of sustainable development
3941,jacobson and price # provide a useful summary of the ways in which human factors contribute to and are affected by likely global changes in particular they stress the importance of the data-handling issues and the role of gis in coping with some of the problems of data integration and manipulation
3942,the issc proposed its own work programme in the human dimensions of global change in late #
3943,while these organizations intrinsically have a world-wide membership and are concerned with research into global environmental change others share the same interest but from a more restricted geographical base
3944,a leading example of this is the european science foundation which has sponsored research programmes in both the physical and social science aspects of environmental change esf #
3945,governmental and political involvement
3946,the spread of environmental awareness is readily demonstrated in # # countries had environmental and natural resource management agencies whereas a decade later the number was # wec #
3947,in most countries the governmental and political concern with the environment has come somewhat later than that of scientists or concerned lay people the early development of the green party in the federal republic of germany is something of an exception
3948,such a commitment to the environment is none the less both welcome and necessary if resources are to be made available to tackle existing let alone forthcoming environmental problems
3949,the conversion of the uk government has been briefly described earlier it is manifested in their july # commitment to spend #m on climate change research in # # and the confident request to them from the advisory board for the research councils abrc for an extra #m in # and #m in the two succeeding years for additional environmental research
3950,perhaps the most significant development of all however is the increasing role of the european commission
3951,their role in bringing environmental impact assessment eia on to the statute book is well known but the commission has now made a proposal cec # for the establishment of the european environment agency and the european environment monitoring and information network
3952,the commission argues that there is at present no monitoring of environmental quality and trends on a european scale nor any guarantee that the results of environmental monitoring will be comparable on a community-wide basis a realization brought about through the corine programme described later
3953,the objectives of the new agency would be to assist the community and the member states to achieve the goals set out in the treaty of rome and in successive environmental action programmes it must also however be seen in the context of the european council's adoption on # december # of the rhodes declaration on the environment and the environment chapter in the single european act which comes into effect in #
3954,the detailed specific roles of the system comprising both agency and network are envisaged as
3955,#
3956,to provide the community the member states and participating third countries with the objective sic information requested for the formulation and implementation of sound and effective environmental policies
3957,#
3958,in particular to provide technical scientific and economic information requested by the commission in its tasks of identification preparation and assessment of the implementation and results of environmental action and legislation
3959,#
3960,to stimulate the development and the application within the agency of techniques of environmental modelling and forecasting in order that adequate preventative action can be taken at the appropriate time
3961,#
3962,to help ensure the harmonization and comparability of environmental data in the community as well as the integration of european environmental data into international environmental monitoring programmes such as those established within the framework of the united nations and its system of agencies
3963,considerable stress is laid by the commission on collaboration with national data-gathering agencies and with states adjacent to the community's borders
3964,it is envisaged that the totality of activities will extend the existing report cec # through addressing the issues of the quality and sensitivity of the environment and also the pressures upon it
3965,priorities for the new agency include study of atmospheric emissions and quality water resources and quality including the marine environment soil erosion and pollution and important land resources and biotopes and nature conservation
3966,at the time of writing the proposal has been approved and discussions are in progress on the location of the agency's headquarters
3967,it seems certain to have major and growing effects upon environmental monitoring and prediction in europe and on the policies of component governments
3968,yet this is by no means the only plan which the community has in relation to the environment directorate-general xii that for science research and development has published details of an extensive r&d programme cec #a and the commission as a whole cec #b has made public its plans to develop regular official statistics of the environment
3969,the private sector
3970,certain aspects of environmental monitoring have long been carried out by the private sector notably that of crop states on a world-wide basis
3971,derived from satellite imagery at comparatively low resolution predicted yields for different crops in different nation states become of commercial value
3972,however significant resources are also being made available by the private sector where there is no immediate commercial gain thus ibm uk ltd has donated #m of computing equipment to unep and ibm in general is actively supporting other r&d which can be expected to facilitate sustainable development ibm europe for instance has invested #m in its bergen scientific centre to make it the focal point for the company's environmental modelling and a centre for information on the environment and sustainable development
3973,on a more modest basis ibm uk have agreed to fund a pilot global population database being built in birkbeck college to permit assessment of the impact of environmental change on the world s population
3974,many other companies of course are supporting environmental work but ibm seems almost to be unique in its corporate commitment to use of high technology for facilitating sustainable development
3975,some examples of environmental monitoring projects
3976,the local scale
3977,at the local scale it is usually impossible to neglect the effects of multiple processes operating
3978,an example of environmental modelling and prediction where the interactions between different processes and dynamic feedback is taken into account is given by haber and schaller #
3979,their work formed part of one unesco man and biosphere mab project carried out in the berchtesgaden national park in bavaria
3980,following holling # and grossman # they conceptualized the man environment relationship at a series of hierarchical levels
3981,#
3982,the lowest or process level is directly and usually obviously connected to perceived reality
3983,thus processes and interrelationships are mostly obvious simple and linear data are usually readily available and may be voluminous
3984,this level is readily handled in commercial gis
3985,#
3986,the intermediate or dynamic level is concerned with less frequent and often irregular events eg a temporary lack of water because of fire frost or excessive demand from an increasing populace
3987,characteristically the data used may be more difficult to obtain and are usually more spatially aggregated modelling software which permits feedback loops is essential
3988,#
3989,the top or strategic level is the most difficult to explore the external influences are often unpredictable by formal means
3990,relevant data are therefore difficult to identify and scenario building is one of the few approaches available
3991,the haber and schaller approach is to soft-couple these different levels and their accompanying approaches using an ecological balance model
3992,results of running this with different scenarios include time slice maps of possible outcomes and of the exchange of material and energy within the study area
3993,while ultimately qualitative it seems to offer a method for coping with different types of process and incorporating stochastic and truly random events
3994,the national and continental scale the corine project
3995,the corine programme represents the product of much activity by the european commission's directorate-general xi for the environment
3996,it originates from an italian request to the council of ministers in # to identify environmentally balanced and unbalanced areas in the community the first attempts to do this were unsuccessful and though by # it was clear that a new approach based on an environmental information system was the most promising one funding for this was not secured until #
3997,a #-year experimental programme to collect co-ordinate and ensure the consistency of information on the state of the environment and natural resources in the european communities was set up and labelled corine
3998,the objectives of corine were to be achieved through bringing together existing data holdings in the member states developing methods for holding analysing and presenting the data and encouraging the exchange of data
3999,a number of priority areas were identified including biotopes of importance for nature conservation acid deposition and its effects on soils and biotopes and the protection of the environment of the mediterranean region briggs and martin #
4000,many achievements can be claimed by the corine project team
4001,as a result of some # sub-projects involving all the member states and often several groups within each one databases of topography soils water resources and quality biotopes atmospheric emissions climate soil erosion and administrative boundaries have been built up for the whole@ community and can be interrelated other data sets such as land cover derived from satellite imagery have already been compiled for some of the member states
4002,various aspects of the corine project have been described in papers by rhind # wiggins # briggs and martin # briggs and mounsey # and cec #c
4003,for the present purposes however the key findings are
4004,#
4005,many necessary data sets were unavailable for reasons of administrative inadequacies confidentiality constraints cost or non-collection in certain countries
4006,#
4007,the unavoidable reliance upon existing data sets led to many problems due to non-harmonization even of commonly used variables eg eight different definitions of potential evapo-transpiration were in use in the member states and maximum temperature at each weather station was defined in at least four different ways
4008,#
4009,the compilation of a spatially coherent database from mapped information compiled by different organizations at different scales and on different topographic bases see rhind and clark # is often difficult
4010,#
4011,user expectations are often unreasonably high use of administrative computing systems encourages bureaucrats to believe that environmental data can just as readily be analysed and used to support decisions
4012,the fuzzy nature of much geographically distributed data the inherent errors in it the effects of the processing algorithms used and the assumption of known interactions between variables ensures that completely routine use by unskilled users is unlikely to be possible in the foreseeable future
4013,#
4014,more detailed data are required for particular tasks as the role of corine grows
4015,the european commission's proposal for an environment agency see above will subsume the corine team and databases
4016,the global scale nasa and gems grid
4017,without question the largest player in the global environment arena is nasa
4018,the organization has initiated many of the schemes which now are under discussion the igbp for instance has been strongly influenced by nasa proposals
4019,a summary of current activities and future plans is given in nasa #b
4020,by way of example current programmes are collecting global data on stratospheric ozone on sea-surface and sea-ice variables and on the earth's radiation budget
4021,approved future programmes include the upper atmosphere research satellite the nasa scatterometer and the joint nasa cnes ocean topography experiment
4022,in addition however funding has recently been approved for a much more ambitious scheme the earth observing system eos
4023,this is conceived not as a set of hardware but as a comprehensive information system focused on the needs identified by the essc see above and anticipating somewhat those of igbp
4024,it will collate data from the two proposed space station polar platforms one european space agency platform a japanese one and also from the manned space station
4025,on this basis a data flow of no less than # terabyte ie #&sup# bytes /day is anticipated by the mid-#
4026,a major user of nasa data and skills has been the un environment programme
4027,formed in the wake of the # stockholm conference unep soon spawned the global environment monitoring system gems as well as an international register of potentially toxic chemicals and a global network of sources to locate and provide technical scientific and management information on the environment
4028,the need for a mechanism to handle the global environmental data was defined in the early # and the global resources information database grid resulted
4029,mooneyhan # has described the progress of the pilot stage of grid which culminated in approval for a full operational phase grid is now involved in integrating storing and exploiting a variety of global environmental databases mostly acquired from nasa
4030,in addition to the work being carried out in the unep hq at nairobi and in the gems grid site in geneva a series of grid regional nodes are now being set up world-wide each equipped with the same hardware and software and local subsets of the data
4031,the first of these is in bangkok and another is to be opened in latin america
4032,moreover national nodes are also being set up the recent ibm gift to grid see above has ensured that powerful microcomputers have been installed in many african countries together with national and continental data sets
4033,training of unskilled staff to operate this equipment and to exploit the scientific data is now a major role for grid staff
4034,technical aspects and problems
4035,it follows from much of the above that there are major challenges in use of environmental data
4036,these are best considered by itemizing characteristics of contemporary environmental monitoring and prediction
4037,#
4038,the use of secondary data rather than primary data collected by the data analyst
4039,#
4040,the need at least with data on the terrestrial environment for an inference process to extract useful information from the secondary and often proxy data
4041,#
4042,the data volumes collected are often voluminous even by the standards of contemporary computing facilities
4043,#
4044,the analyses carried out are often arcane in detail to all but a small group of high priests
4045,#
4046,we have only a limited capacity for checking the accuracy of many environmental monitoring results let alone of predictions
4047,some of these characteristics are now addressed in slightly more detail it will be obvious that such problems merit a paper in themselves
4048,remote sensing as a data collection process
4049,as the need for more extensive high-resolution yet consistent and up-to-date data becomes more pressing increased use of remote sensing seems inevitable
4050,no other data collection methodology obviates the short distance variation in data sets induced by variations in data collection and aggregation methodology typically encountered between adjacent nation states
4051,the problem is now recognized especially in europe and strenuous efforts are being made to harmonise the data sets eg through the use of standard classifications such as that for land use produced by the conference of european statisticians in #
4052,at present however ground-collected environmental data are far less than ideal
4053,recognizing this nasa #a concluded that forthcoming global science projects would need land surface altitude data at three resolutions # km resolution in xy and ## m resolution in z on a global basis # m xy resolution and ## m resolution in z for regional databases and # m xy resolution and ## m in z for local studies
4054,they argued that existing maps and digitized files from them are unable to meet these needs at global or regional scale and only remote sensing could help in the short term the availability of stereometric data from the french spot satellite has already led to proposals for automated creation of global digital elevation models with a spatial xy resolution of about # m muller #
4055,for many terrestrial purposes however a substantial inference process must take place to convert the radiometric measurements into useful information in contrast more direct measurements of sea state etc are possible
4056,the value of this information is inherently dependent upon the quality of the inference process and that in turn depends upon the complexity of the scene the spatial temporal and spectral resolution of the sensors and the particular algorithms used
4057,thus far for instance accuracies of land cover let alone what is often needed ie land use determined from landsat and spot imagery for the uk have rarely been higher than # per cent unless trivial classifications eg built unbuilt land have been used
4058,one solution to this is to densify the ground control and another is to use contextually based classifiers rather than the traditional spectrally based ones
4059,but the ground conditions in some parts of europe make good results extremely difficult to obtain some areas of portugal for instance have field sizes of only a few metres and exhibit multi-level and multi-seasonal cropping
4060,a further difficulty is the cost of the data in relation to its anticipated benefits
4061,relatively few cost benefit studies have yet been carried out except in such areas as crop prediction and ocean navigation where they are generally shown to be highly advantageous in saving someone else's money
4062,it may be that a study commissioned from contractors by the british national space centre will provide useful evidence on the cash value of remote sensing it is particularly timely in view of the appointment of professor pearce see above as the adviser to the uk secretary of state for the environment
4063,other work on assessment of costs and benefits of such data have been carried out for the french government by professor didier #
4064,finally since data are often costly to acquire it follows that summaries of them eg report cec # and the of the un ep gems marc # are of considerable value
4065,equally the signposting role now being adopted by unep's grid project which is expected to offer on-line access to a catalogue of environmental data sets and details of the responsible agencies in # is to be welcomed
4066,the data problem and partial solutions
4067,the lack of harmonization of definitions and methods of collection of environmental data have already been outlined above
4068,in the european community of # nation states for instance no less than eight procedures for calculating potential evapo-transpiration have been in use
4069,the need for harmonization is obvious and in this respect must follow from the successful pioneering achievements of eurostat in harmonizing the definitions in trade demographic and other social science statistics see cec #b
4070,an additional and severe problem is that the volumes of data which are already collected are huge by the standards of only a decade ago
4071,by # # they will be very much greater notably from the eos programme
4072,nasa has announced plans to collect up to # terabyte #&sup# bytes /day
4073,since remote sensing data sets especially those pertaining to terrestrial areas of the globe typically need much pre-processing to calibrate transform and then perform an inference process and hence convert measurements of the radiation reflected or emitted by small areas of ground into useful eg land cover data the processing power required is going to be formidable
4074,other non-remote-sensing data sets are smaller in volume but more complex in structure and in their characteristics
4075,to hold all of the # # # scale topographic map coverage alone for the european community would probably require about # terabytes of storage
4076,parenthetically the form in which the data may be held can affect dramatically the scale of the problem faced
4077,it would be technically possible for instance to hold in less than # terabyte detailed information for every individual in the world akin to that collected about everyone in the uk through the census of population
4078,in practice legislation generally forbids such data being held thus and distributed in anything other than area aggregate form the cross-tabulations commonly employed eg to give tables of population numbers broken down by age and sex often result in a great multiplication of the data volumes
4079,this all presents major problems of data storage handling especially for global data sets display and dissemination
4080,fortunately technical developments have ensured that the increase in computing power per unit cost has been growing at about an order of magnitude every # years over the last three decades
4081,indeed this may grossly under-represent the present situation the rapid spread of unix-based systems seems to facilitate competition and at the time of writing performance of workstations per unit cost seems to be increasing at about # per cent per annum
4082,moreover the advent of low-cost high-density-storage devices like cd-roms may well make substantial data sets available even to those with modest computing power a cd-rom for instance can hold about # megabytes ie #&sup# bytes can be reproduced currently for about # and read on a device costing about #
4083,yet despite such revolutionary changes in technology novel solutions will still be required to make effective use of the new data sets
4084,one such solution is goodchild and yang's # scheme for a hierarchical spatial data structure to handle data for the spherical earth
4085,a particular problem is that little or no quantitative regard has been paid until recently to the effects of quality variation in environmental data
4086,the literature of the last few years is thronged with papers proposing that these must be taken into account but with few realistic proposals on how this is to be achieved
4087,goodchild # has made perhaps the best summary of the problem and possible solutions to date
4088,finally relatively little emphasis has been given to the management of data as a corporate resource available to a wide community many environmental data are collected on a project-by-project basis and lost once the urgency of the initial research is over
4089,however the # report of the data and facilities working group of the uk inter-agency committee on global environmental change argued strongly that planning for the dissemination and maintenance of such data was a vital role
4090,it also noted that ownership of and access to environmental data was a policy matter of the greatest importance this may be more difficult in within country data than with global data since the latter are often already the subject of international exchange agreements at zero cost 
4091,global environmental research and the social sciences
4092,thus far the emphasis has been very much on the natural science aspects of environmental monitoring and prediction
4093,that is unremarkable since the anticipation of such problems and assessments of some of their causes and magnitudes can only be made by environmental scientists
4094,yet the consequences of any significant changes are a matter of the utmost concern to planners and to politicians at all levels the quantification of the costs and benefits of alternative policy strategies is very much a matter for economists and the adaptation of societies to massive change is a particular interest to sociologists and others
4095,for geographers who span the conventional and now archaic dichotomy between the natural and the environmental sciences all of these aspects need to be woven together to anticipate the likely spatial patterns of the effects of massive change the redistributions in trade health and wealth which they will bring about and the knock on effects these consequences themselves will have on society and the environment
4096,for social scientists then environmental monitoring and prediction are a matter of considerable significance especially as globalization of markets and economies proceeds
4097,the economic and social research council esrc commissioned two reports on global environmental change to guide or at least inform the allocation of research funding
4098,these reports pearce # turner # may be taken as informed views from at least the economists in the uk social science community on the social science aspects of global environmental change
4099,pearce # for instance presented an economist's views of the high-priority topics for research as follows
4100,#
4101,the theory and practice of international agreements viewed in a game theory context
4102,#
4103,the theory of optimal behaviour under scientific uncertainty
4104,#
4105,cost-benefit frameworks especially for dealing with man-induced climatic effects
4106,#
4107,definition of the impacts of climate change on eastern europe and the developing countries
4108,#
4109,appropriate policies on non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gases
4110,#
4111,assessment of the ecological values of tropical forest
4112,#
4113,economic instruments for reducing greenhouse gases
4114,#
4115,the international politics of climate change
4116,#
4117,national and global energy options given the greenhouse effect
4118,#
4119,trade and global change
4120,turner # argued that the priorities are as follows
4121,#
4122,the socio-economic consequences of sea-level rise
4123,#
4124,techniques for the valuation of environmental resources and effects
4125,#
4126,an assessment of management tools institutional adaptation and policy integration in regard to global environmental change
4127,#
4128,studies of agriculture in relation to climate change
4129,#
4130,understanding of how environmental issues and technical change interact
4131,#
4132,the interrelationship between environmental ethics and economics
4133,there is then no shortage of social science research which is claimed to be necessary if we are to cope with environmental change
4134,some of it is being carried out in march # esrc announced a #m programme of research on global environmental change
4135,however perhaps most critical of all in the early stages is social science practice rather than research
4136,in the usa at least there needs to be an improvement in scientists' understandings of how to influence the allocation of funding for remedial measures or for further research see kitsos and ashe #
4137,all too often it seems that the coupling of an as yet imperfect scientific understanding to policy-making is tenuous see table #
4138,fortunately considerable high-quality work has already begun on the legal political and institutional aspects of global environmental change see for instance nitze #
4139,what next
4140,the contents of this chapter have scarcely touched upon such important environmental research as the world ocean climate experiment or the world climate research programme
4141,nor has there been any discussion of the growing requirement in the uk as elsewhere to carry out an environmental impact assessment for all major developments
4142,the consequences for some nations or subgroups in a population of being without access to environmental data or the tools for analysing them while others have such access are potentially profound as the european commission has recognized in issuing a directive on public access to environmental data cec #d yet space limitations have also precluded their discussion
4143,despite these shortcomings dictated by the space available what has been said should be sufficient to illustrate the enormous and diverse scope of environmental monitoring and prediction
4144,such is its diversity that measuring the total expenditure on it seems quite impossible and the number of actors already involved is vast
4145,what is clear however is that monitoring is rarely a simple exercise that the time-scales of the sponsors of monitoring and environmental research are rarely long term though most science is inevitably of this nature and that the increasingly multinational nature of such work necessitates a degree of management not always present in local or nationally based schemes
4146,in these circumstances it is scarcely surprising that there is evidence of international and interdisciplinary dispute as terney # has chronicled in regard to igbp
4147,moreover as newby # has pointed out the complexities of environmental research have created a new kind of relationship between research and policy in the past the relationship was predicated on the belief that science provided decision-makers with objective hard facts on which to base their soft value-ridden policies
4148,but now we find scientists delivering only soft uncertain facts to decision-makers facing hard decisions
4149,yet even if all of this causes great uncertainty among scientists it is still a reasonable prediction that a decade ahead will see both environmental monitoring and prediction treated as an everyday need and activity in major organizations
4150,we shall also see the existence of binding requirements upon national governments certainly in the european community to collect at least basic environmental indicators in a harmonized form cec #b
4151,more than that it seems highly likely that the social science aspects of environmental problems will underpin the actions of governments and international agencies
4152,perhaps the single most important conclusion to be drawn from this review is that the monitoring modelling and management of the global environment are tasks which uniquely require the integration of skills and techniques from many disciplines
4153,building such research teams is essential
4154,underlying it all however is one obvious fact that the gathering and analysis of geographically distributed environmental data form the necessary starting-point for ensuring the success of our future on earth

4158,managing natural and technological hazards
4159,anthony c gatrell and peter vincent
4160,introduction
4161,few areas of the application of gis technology can be as socially significant or environmentally relevant as the management of emergencies and disasters due to natural and technological hazards
4162,whether attempting to construct a database of resources for use in planning responses to nuclear emergencies developing optimal routes for scheduling the safe transport of hazardous substances or monitoring the health implications of a disaster gis can assist in identifying possibilities and formulating solutions
4163,the # have been declared the 
4164,let us hope that g#s can in some small way help mitigate the suffering and hardship felt by all those afflicted by the effects of hazards which as we have learnt with bitter recent experience in the uk can occur in an untimely fashion in the most improbable of places
4165,research on hazards is multidisciplinary and straddles the social environmental and mathematical sciences
4166,if for instance we wish to model the dispersal of a plume of toxic gas resulting from a chemical explosion assess its possible impact on human health and evaluate likely evacuation scenarios of the population at risk we would require for example a knowledge of atmospheric dispersion models epidemiology and population distribution
4167,some researchers suggest that hazards and emergencies that might result can be regarded as either natural or technological
4168,we shall elaborate on this simple division below but suggest here that the wealth of literature on the former see for instance burton # and perry # has yet to be matched by a similar volume of work on the latter
4169,there are signs that this imbalance is being rectified zeigler #
4170,hazard research like few other gis application areas is not only stretching the present technology to its limits but is a quite remarkable focus of international effort into several important research-related areas such as expert systems and simulation studies
4171,in this sense the scene is clearly one of hazard problems looking for improved gis rather than for gis looking for good problems as is all too often the case
4172,hazard research
4173,what are hazards
4174,formally a hazard can be defined as a physical situation with a potential for human injury damage to property damage to the environment or some combination of these health and safety executive # #
4175,a hazard is a threat which given a set of circumstances may become translated into a realized event
4176,what we choose to call this event depends upon factors such as its magnitude we speak for instance of accidents emergencies disasters and catastrophes each of which carries connotations concerning the scale of the event and each of which will have a set of human and or environmental consequences
4177,on # march # one of the most powerful volcanic disturbances this century the bezymianny eruption occurred
4178,few people noticed the event as it took place in an uninhabited part of kamchatcka and caused no known casualties
4179,in contrast the extrusion of a small volume of lava from a secondary cone on the slopes of tristan da cunha became the focus of global interest when during october # the island's lobster processing plant was smothered and the # people of the island's only settlement were evacuated to the uk
4180,these two contrasting events emphasize the central fact that even natural hazards are not defined solely by the characteristics of the event but by the interaction of those events with the human occupation of the threatened area
4181,as noted above the simple division of hazards is between those which are natural and those which are technological or human-induced
4182,each of these may be further subdivided and the typology shown in fig # draws upon the classic work of burton and kates # in separating geophysical from biological hazards and zeigler # in distinguishing public or what we might call societal hazards from private individual ones
4183,the further subdivision of natural hazards is self-explanatory as is that of individual technological hazards
4184,zeigler divides the public hazards into those which result from the production of raw materials and manufactured goods those which originate in transport and transmission and those which threaten the public in their role as consumers
4185,the united nations disaster relief organization undro has produced a classification of disasters derived on the basis of case data table #
4186,undro recognizes three basic types of disaster accidents natural events and other disasters
4187,the differentiation of accidents from other types is useful in the context of emergency planning and is not so clearly conveyed by other hazard typologies
4188,however the temptation in all classification exercises is to produce partitional schemes and this should really be resisted here
4189,it is more useful johnson # to adopt a non-partitional scheme fig # that recognizes for instance food poisoning as both a personal and consumer hazard or lead pollution eg from car exhausts as both a meteorological event and technological hazard both public and private
4190,an air crash as at lockerbie affects an entire community directly as well as being an occupational hazard and risk to the individual traveller
4191,hillslope failure as at aberfan in south wales in # is a geomorphic hazard but may arise because of raw material extraction
4192,dutch elm disease is a floral hazard but is exacerbated by the transport of infected logs
4193,hohensemer # make the important point that hazards are multidimensional in nature and suggest # dimensions along which any hazard may be scored see table #
4194,these factors will of course be important in deciding on the role that gis can play in hazard monitoring and emergency planning
4195,for instance some events will persist briefly have immediate consequences minor transgenerational effects and have little or no potential for non-human mortality an air crash is an example
4196,others such as a chemical explosion involving the release of a toxic gas may persist for a week or more have delayed consequences may affect a future generation if the toxic chemical is mutagenic and may have a significant impact on plant and animal populations
4197,there may be more scope for a gis approach in the latter than in the former situations
4198,the hohensemer scheme is not however beyond criticism
4199,for example can hazards really be thought of as having any intentionality
4200,industrial hazards and risk assessment
4201,once hazards have been identified there may follow efforts to assess the hazard risk
4202,by risk we understand the likelihood of a specified undesired event occurring within a specified period or in specified circumstances health and safety executive # #
4203,it may of course be easier to quantify risk for natural hazards because of historical records and statistical estimation of recurrence intervals
4204,technological hazards are more unpredictable and may be extremely rare so that it becomes difficult to use probability concepts to quantify risk especially those which rely on notions of relative frequency
4205,the identification of chemical hazards requires that the locations of sites be known together with the dangerous substances stored or processed there
4206,in the uk see petts # for a splendid overview the health and safety executive must be notified of sites where hazardous substances in excess of threshold limits are handled
4207,such substances and thresholds include for instance # tonnes of flammable liquid petroleum gas and the explosive sodium chlorate and # tonnes of toxic chlorine gas
4208,some # installations are notifiable along with thousands of kilometres of pipelines mostly high-pressure natural gas transmission lines
4209,following a number of major accidents involving industrial activities including those at flixborough humberside in # beek the netherlands in # and seveso and manfredonia in italy in # the ec issued a directive on major accident hazards
4210,the directive which is commonly referred to as the seveso directive was issued in june # and in the uk its requirements were embodied in the control of major accident hazard cimah regulations #
4211,among other things these regulations require operators of hazardous installations to draw up on-site and off-site emergency plans and to give information to members of the public who live or work near such installations houston #
4212,there are presently about # cimah sites
4213,however many potentially hazardous chemical installations are not covered by such regulations
4214,clearly a plant which stores # tonne less than is required for notification slips through the net while large numbers of handling sites warehouses for instance are not covered
4215,the regulations have obvious implications for g#s work as illustrated below
4216,in halton borough cheshire for instance there are # notifiable installations with over # # people living within the defined consultation zones petts #
4217,it is also relevant to point out here the work of the health and safety executive in developing techniques for quantitative risk assessment health and safety executive #
4218,such techniques include the use of a risk assessment tool riskat inputs to which include data on wind direction and speed the output of which is a map of calculated risk contours
4219,in societal risk assessment it is also necessary to input data on the distribution of population around the installation
4220,this can be a difficult and time-consuming process and inevitably some simplifying assumptions are needed health and safety executive # #
4221,again the g#s implications are clear and are discussed below
4222,hazardous waste disposal
4223,the disposal of both nuclear and non-nuclear wastes has proved to be of major public concern in recent years
4224,the rather clumsy handling by nirex of the search for sites to store lowand intermediate-level wastes together with very recent worries about the import of toxic wastes such as polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs are but two examples of such concern in the uk
4225,however while the former has been given considerable attention by geographers summarized by openshaw # there has been relatively little such work in the uk on the disposal of non-nuclear wastes
4226,this contrasts with the situation in the usa greenberg and anderson # where the clean-up of abandoned sites is a priority
4227,certainly in terms of the volume of waste generated in the uk non-nuclear hazardous industrial wastes should be high on the environmental agenda while less than # million tonnes of all nuclear wastes were generated in ## # times that amount were generated of hazardous wastes openshaw # #
4228,attention should be drawn to the three annual reports of the hazardous waste inspectorate now merged with other branches of the doe to form her majesty's inspectorate of pollution
4229,these contain some valuable material on disposal practices and volumes of waste generated and disposed of by each waste regulation authority wra counties in england districts in wales scotland and northern ireland
4230,each wra is required to produce a waste disposal plan and these are starting to appear
4231,they too contain useful material on for instance the locations of sites though individual site licences must be consulted for details of what each is permitted to take in the way of hazardous wastes
4232,what is not known is information on the locations of former sites at which quite toxic materials may have been dumped though recent work by egger # in austria has mapped a vast number of such sites
4233,it is these rather than existing licensed sites which should be a focus of research activity particularly when examining possible links to ill health
4234,we simply do not have enough evidence yet to back up the claim that people are almost certainly ill dead or dying because of these sloppy waste disposal activities openshaw # #
4235,research is in progress however to assess possible health effects of poor incineration diggle #
4236,particular attention should be focused on hospital incinerators since these have been subject to crown immunity for many years and most are technically ill-equipped to burn at sufficiently high temperatures for adequate disposal of wastes gatrell and lovett #
4237,we need to produce an inventory of all such sites together with a publicly available comprehensive database on all sites accepting hazardous industrial wastes
4238,emergency planning
4239,it is convenient to retain the nuclear non-nuclear distinction when discussing the background to emergency planning
4240,nuclear emergency planning in the uk has been reviewed by matthews and pepper #
4241,nuclear power stations must prepare a plan and submit this to the nuclear installations inspectorate and health and safety executive for approval
4242,evacuation plans are required to cover an area within a distance of # km these detail the roles to be played by the emergency services
4243,the very narrow emergency planning zones contrast with those in the usa collins # where planning is required up to # km from the site to cover exposure to radiation plumes
4244,local authorities in the uk that have declared themselves nuclear-free have been highly critical of british planning calling for an extension of emergency zones to at least # km
4245,zeigler # should be consulted for material relating to evacuation behaviour in the wake of the incident at three mile island
4246,in the uk little work of any description seems to have been done on human behaviour in the aftermath of releases of hazardous substances nor is much available on public attitudes to emergency planning
4247,indeed no major studies of evacuation due to hazards have been undertaken in recent times and this is a widely recognized deficiency which no research funding body seems willing to rectify
4248,in the usa on the other hand a good deal of useful research in these areas has been undertaken
4249,this research is brought together in very useful reports produced by the oak ridge national laboratory tennessee sorenson # vogt and sorenson # and the disaster research centre university of delaware
4250,perry # has written an interesting book on emergency planning and evacuation covering both natural and technological hazards
4251,for him comprehensive emergency planning and management involve prevention protection response and restoration
4252,by prevention we understand the elimination or reduction in risk perhaps by adequate zoning or safe routeing of shipments for instance
4253,included in protection are methods for detecting likely hazard events and in warning those likely to be affected
4254,response includes search and rescue including the need to cope with secondary threats such as contamination of water supplies after an explosion or fire following an earthquake
4255,as perry and others have noted relatively few resources are devoted to the first two aspects the bulk going to response and restoration rebuilding
4256,it should be clear from this brief description that these issues are inherently geographical
4257,in one of the few studies of evacuation behaviour after a non-nuclear hazard event liverman and wilson # give weight to this argument
4258,in # a train carrying chlorine liquid petroleum toluene and propane was derailed in mississauga ontario causing a series of explosions
4259,this led to the evacuation of # # people which although staggered over several days led to great pressure on transport arteries
4260,an important finding was that many relied on their own transport and went to stay with friends and relatives some distance away rather than relying on the # official evacuation reception centres
4261,despite this the evacuation was successful partly because the accident occurred at a weekend and the immediately affected area was sparsely populated
4262,in addition the police were well prepared stimulated largely by implementing a plan designed more to cope with an emergency at the nearby toronto international airport than for the event in question
4263,it is not without interest to note that in the usa there is a federal emergency management agency fema established in # charged with dealing with all types of emergency planning and management
4264,in the uk there is no equivalent though the spate of disasters in the past # years involving over # lives lost has led to several calls for such a national body to be established 
4265,natural hazards
4266,in this short space it is not possible to go into any depth on the nature of particular natural hazards but only to highlight those aspects relevant to gis
4267,needless to say the study of natural hazards is important a statement brought into sharp focus by the fact that natural hazards account for up to # per cent of total deaths in the world each year mitchell #
4268,in # for example more than # # people died in the cyclone and flooding of bangladesh and in # the hurricanes david and frederick caused more than #bn damage in the usa
4269,shah # made a comprehensive investigation of natural disaster reports for the period ## and concluded that both disaster frequency and magnitude measured in terms of lives lost are increasing
4270,high death tolls are still a characteristic of less developed low-income countries
4271,surprisingly fog is the third most important hazard in europe after floods and volcanoes
4272,research on natural hazards has a long tradition in geography going back more than half a century
4273,much of the impetus for such research arose in the usa from observations on river basin management and the need to reduce flood damage
4274,the vast majority of natural hazards studies have ignored the physical nature of the events and have concentrated on behavioural issues such as the perception and estimation of hazards
4275,this emphasis is partly due to the background of the researchers involved many are human geographers and sociologists and partly because it is only really since the second world war that major hazards have been monitored systematically culminating of course in the last decade or so in the use of satellite technology
4276,brief reference to two examples of natural hazards may illustrate the potential relevance of a gis approach applications of which are considered below
4277,jones # have examined the distribution of some # landslides in the uk
4278,their maps show clearly an increased propensity for landsliding in the north and west of the uk
4279,more to the point however is the fact that this distribution can be modelled in terms of slopes rainfall rock types and so on
4280,in other words the actual hazard distribution can be understood and areas at risk identified
4281,the potential benefits to insurance companies engineers and planners are clear
4282,second a well-known winter hazard in the uk with marked spatial localization is fog
4283,predictive models of its distribution have clear implications for road and air safety
4284,perry # describes a fog potential index that is a function of local topography environmental features affecting fog formation and distance from standing water bodies
4285,reliance is currently placed on a network of monitoring stations often sparsely located and frequently outside fog-prone areas gis could implement a predictive model based on digitized map features and indeed the model could also be used in site allocation studies for airports and the like
4286,the majority of natural hazard research has focused on single hazards but of course any area may be prone to more than one hazard type
4287,this idea led hewitt and burton # to develop the concept of all-hazards-at-a-place
4288,to achieve this they concentrated on the whole@ spectrum of damaging events in an area and explored their aggregate impact
4289,the implications for gis in the development of hazardousness indices are obvious and if time-series data are available there is the potential to produce a variety of probability maps
4290,the collection of historical data on natural hazards is important since it is clear that their spatial pattern varies through time
4291,many areas that appear to be hazard-free on current maps may merely by passing through a temporary period of quiescence
4292,this is perhaps best illustrated with reference to earthquakes
4293,for example in # the whole of southern england was affected by an earthquake whose epicentre was located in what is now belgium a good deal of minor structural damage was inflicted morse #
4294,presumably the builders of the channel tunnel are aware of this
4295,environmental epidemiology
4296,this is of course a vast subject area embracing the impact of the natural and technological environments on human health
4297,it covers for instance the associations between water and air pollution and ill health links between geological and pedological environments and ill health as well as associations between specific technological hazards eg high-voltage power lines and possible health effects
4298,we can only consider a small fraction of this work here little consideration is given to occupational environments for instance
4299,in the uk such research is widespread though there are specialist environmental epidemiology research institutes at southampton and cardiff funded by the medical research council and others at the university of surrey robens institute and at the london school for hygiene and tropical medicine
4300,the latter houses the small area health statistics research unit sahsru which has a specific remit to conduct research into morbidity and mortality at local scales elliot #
4301,the sahsru liaises closely with opcs
4302,the kinds of databases used by these groups are discussed below
4303,greenberg # and a collection of papers in greenberg # review some of the literature on environmental epidemiology
4304,it seems worth stating at the outset that there are two ways geographical research in this general area can proceed
4305,one is to collect morbidity and mortality data usually the latter is more widely available though the former more useful and to examine spatial distributions for clustering
4306,this has itself generated a substantial literature see the papers in elliot # for an overview and is nowhere better exemplified than in openshaw's geographical analysis machine see ch #
4307,we then search retrospectively for evidence of possible environmental associations
4308,an alternative approach is to begin by hypothesizing an environmental determinant of ill health and to collect data to test an explicit hypothesis
4309,if an association is suggested then we would want to collect data in other areas to assess the hypothesis further
4310,of course these two approaches are not clear-cut in practice in many cases the hypotheses of interest will have themselves been generated by inductive mapping
4311,one example of an hypothesis which has been given serious attention in recent years is the possible link between electromagnetic fields generated by high-voltage power lines or supply cables and ill health
4312,some work perry # suggested associations with mental illness and suicide while others eg wertheimer and leeper # have examined links to various cancers including leukaemias
4313,a good bibliography is provided in perry and pearl #
4314,the central electricity generating board now privatized and split into two companies is funding a large-scale #-year project to assess links to childhood cancer while another recently announced study aims to look at links to sudden infant death
4315,one obvious problem with implications for any gis input is that the effects are highly localized with little measurable field effect more than a few dozen metres away from the route centre-lines
4316,accuracy of digital data collection either of the power lines or residential locations is paramount
4317,there seems to be a growing interest in examining associations between ill health and the geological environment
4318,gis work in this field eg matthews # is reviewed later but we note here the work of the applied geochemistry group at imperial college responsible for a series of atlases on regional geochemistry and the existence of a society for environmental geochemistry and health
4319,one area of recent debate concerns radon gas and its links to lung cancer
4320,this is taken very seriously in the usa where the environmental protection agency estimates that # ## # deaths from lung cancer each year are due to radon gas exposure
4321,estimates from scandinavia suggest that ## per cent of such deaths are caused by exposure to radon richardson # ##
4322,the gas is trapped in well-insulated houses and is produced by the decay of uranium in rocks and soil thus it has been measured at high concentrations in parts of cornwall and devon
4323,there are great difficulties in assessing health effects however since exposure varies greatly from house to house within small neighbourhoods
4324,carefully designed case-control studies are therefore required to measure the separate effect of radon exposure after controlling for smoking behaviour and other risk factors
4325,other health concerns which might merit attention by those involved in the regional research laboratory rrl initiative include air and water pollution
4326,the debate about lead pollution from vehicle exhaust emissions is well known less publicity has been given to pahs polychlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons a product of combustion processes and known to be carcinogenic lioy and daisey #
4327,research at the north west regional research laboratory nwrrl aims to create buffers around busy roads and junctions and to use data from the cancer registry to examine possible links between proximity to such sources of pollution and prevalence of lung cancer
4328,those with an interest in health and air pollution should note the availability of a very detailed database from the warren springs laboratory containing details of smoke and sulphur dioxide emissions at a large number of sites in the uk
4329,the possible link between nitrates in water and stomach cancer is the subject of much debate beresford # as is the association between aluminium content and alzheimer's disease
4330,the problems of assessing such links are of course huge but there is scope for a contribution
4331,the role of gis in hazard management scenarios examples
4332,as we have already implied gis has a role to play in all aspects of hazard research from hazard monitoring risk assessment and emergency planning to coping with an event and evaluating its consequences
4333,the examples described below illustrate all these though as yet there do not appear to be many instances of disasters in the management of which gis has played a significant part
4334,technological hazards emergency planning and gis
4335,a considerable amount of research has been undertaken to apply gis methods to evacuation scenarios around hazardous sites
4336,much of this research has concentrated on network analysis of the road system
4337,reference was made above to so-called cimah sites major hazardous installations for which on-site and off-site emergency plans must be prepared
4338,early research at the nwrrl focused on developing a gis for use by the police and county emergency planning officers in cumbria that would aid in the management of a possible explosion at a chemical factory in whitehaven west cumbria vincent # dunn #
4339,the police required a portable system that could be implemented on an ibm-compatible microcomputer
4340,this was written at the nwrrl using fortran # and the graphical kernel system
4341,the gis is menu-based and is exceptionally user-friendly pl #
4342,it opens with an outline map and the superimposition of the rather rigid zones used by the emergency planners
4343,full zoom facilities are available at any stage
4344,in any emergency it is of course vital to have high-quality data on the distribution of population and resources
4345,the system incorporates digitized data on the distribution of all domestic and non-domestic properties in the town together with digitized road centre-line data
4346,both sets of data were provided by pinpoint analysis ltd who are undertaking this digitizing task for the entire country
4347,other spatially referenced data incorporated into the system include those on the distribution of schools medical and transport services which can be displayed and supplementary information about them obtained
4348,the gis permits population estimates to be made for any arbitrary rectangular region on the map
4349,most significantly it incorporates a shortest path algorithm which uses the road network to find optimal routes between user-defined start and end nodes
4350,although predating the rrl initiative by several years and indeed the emergence of gis as a major research area we should remind ourselves of openshaw's work on appraising nuclear reactor sites
4351,using what would now be called gis skills openshaw # examined over # # # km grid squares in the uk which intersect the coastline and related these to data from the # census which were made available for such grid squares
4352,he demonstrated that there is an abundance of remote sites in contrast to the official view that such sites were increasingly hard to find
4353,he suggested that in early spatial searches for sites only a small number were ever identified in the first place because rigorous searches could not be performed by manual means with poor quality data openshaw # #
4354,heywood and cornelius # have shown how gis can be used for monitoring possible radiation releases and thus the relevance of gis in nuclear emergency planning and monitoring
4355,they propose a national radiological spatial information system and in a pilot project in cumbria have integrated several layers of data within arc info to show what this might involve fig #
4356,such data include those from the population and agricultural censuses as well as point data from rain gauge sites and radiation monitoring stations
4357,as an example the system is used to determine restriction zones for the movement of sheep after the explosion at chernobyl in #
4358,this is done by finding areas of high rainfall and parishes with high sheep populations
4359,the map overlay of point and area information shows generally good agreement with the restriction zones imposed by the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food with the exception of a small area to the south-east of cumbria bordering on lancashire 
4360,the british government carried out a review of its arrangements for handling nuclear accidents overseas following the chernobyl accident
4361,the doe through her majesty's inspectorate of pollution hmip was given the task of co-ordinating a national response plan installing the radiation monitoring network and acting as lead government department in an emergency hmso #
4362,the monitoring network has become known as the radioactive incident monitoring network rimnet and has as its prime responsibility the detection of abnormal increases in radiation levels within the uk of the kind that might arise from an overseas nuclear accident
4363,the full implementation of the rimnet system will take some time
4364,by the end of # gamma radiation dose monitors had been installed at # meteorological stations as part of phase # of the development programme
4365,radiation readings are taken every hour at each station and are transmitted to a central computer which analyses the data
4366,the current criterion for alert is two readings of more than three times normal background either successively at the same site or simultaneously at two adjacent sites
4367,the dissemination of information in the event of an incident is dealt with at three levels the first is the normal system of press notices the second is the use of teletext and viewdata ceefax and prestel to get direct to members of the public at their homes or places of work the third is the use of telecom gold electronic mail to get more technical details to various official bodies such as water authorities jackson #
4368,phase # of the rimnet scheme will be completed by the end of # when between # and # monitoring sites will have been established
4369,given very wide regional and local variations in deposition questions must be raised about the effectiveness of such a small network local authorities will need to supplement it with their own networks
4370,there are important analytical problems to be addressed concerning the siting of such monitoring equipment and these are elaborated on later
4371,abroad kaspar # has discussed a computer-based exercise with gis overtones involving the simulated evacuation of the population living in the vicinity of the neckarwestheim nuclear power plant in baden wrttemberg
4372,in the scenario he outlines an area affected by radioactive releases is determined the population within that area is allocated to reception areas with capacity constraints evacuation routes are identified and traffic restrictions implemented
4373,little detail is provided however and it is thus difficult to evaluate his work fully
4374,dangermond # describes the use of the arc info network module for use in emergency planning situations
4375,he describes how a road network is digitized and subsequently analysed using allocation districting and routeing algorithms
4376,allocation determines which arcs in the network will be allocated to a particular node or centre districting makes it possible to outline rapidly sets of polygons in order to define specific areas of interest districts and to summarize their characteristics routeing provides a minimum path algorithm through the network the arcs of which can be assigned weights according to road conditions road capacity and so on
4377,dangermond gives several examples in his paper including the use of network for the allocation of emergency vehicles optimum routeing of fire engines from garages to the accident scene and the movement of spills through sewers and river networks
4378,when combined with the other facilities in arc info quite complex disaster management scenarios can be handled
4379,for example earthquake fault zones can be combined with data on housing density and structural details to predict earthquake damage levels and these data then related to the network model
4380,vincent # illustrates the use of arc info and its network module for finding safe routes for chlorine transhipment on the road and rail systems of north-west england pl #
4381,in this case population density data for a # km buffer on either side of network arcs were overlaid on the network itself so as to act as weights for the minimum path algorithm
4382,chosen routes were those which minimized population rather than distance
4383,hazardous waste disposal
4384,there can be little doubt that a gis approach has wide applicability in all sorts of location problems where the goal is to minimize rather than as conventionally maximize accessibility to a population
4385,a particularly good application is to the search for potential sites for the disposal of nuclear and non-nuclear but none the less hazardous wastes
4386,we discuss here some relevant work on the siting of facilities for the disposal of nuclear wastes before examining those for non-nuclear wastes
4387,the major contribution to informed debate about the search for sites for the disposal of nuclear wastes has come from a group of geographers openshaw # and a gis approach to this problem can pay high dividends
4388,the work of carver see openshaw # ch # is an interesting example
4389,one advantage is the ability to model a range of alternatives by allowing particular criteria to enter or be omitted from the polygon overlay operation
4390,conceptually what is offered is little more than an automated sieve mapping that land-use planners have used for many years but the whole@ procedure is speeded up by many orders of magnitude using gis software
4391,the authors examine both near-surface sites and deep repositories which use more restricted population criteria and allow offshore locations to enter
4392,data layers include geological maps conservation areas transport routes petrochemical facilities and demographic data
4393,as different layers are added sequentially we see how the proportion of available land shrinks pl # for instance when geological criteria are set in the search for a deep repository # per cent of land area remains and the addition of the population density layer reduces this to # per cent
4394,however adding a proximity to transport constraint lowers this to # per cent and so on
4395,we cannot pretend gis is a solution to the political problems of negotiation and justification but at the very least the openness of the procedures goes some way towards satisfying a worried public 
4396,gis research into site selection for non-nuclear hazardous waste has been almost exclusively conducted in north america and has yet to be matched in the uk
4397,jensen and christiansen # working in the south-eastern usa use a raster approach with a pixel resolution of # m&sup# and boolean overlay to weed out particular sites such as those which are poorly drained environmentally sensitive or inaccessible see also stewart #
4398,environmental monitoring of sites for the disposal of toxic waste is of particular concern in the usa
4399,the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla legislation of # superfund requires the cleaning up of the worst landfill sites of which some # had been identified by the environmental protection agency by # foresman #
4400,a major worry has been the threat posed by groundwater pollution and some research has been conducted on using gis to monitor this merchant # barringer # von braun #
4401,this is an important topic since # per cent of rural households in the usa consume only groundwater while half the us population consumes at least some groundwater merchant #
4402,clearly the research demands access to exceptionally good environmental data usually in three dimensions
4403,as foresman # suggests we might expect remote sensing technology to play a major role
4404,merchant # for example use the image processing system erdas to construct an index of vulnerability to groundwater pollution this uses variables such as depth to water table soil type slope and so on see estes # for a similar approach
4405,barringer # overlay data on soil type and geology with that of groundwater quality hardness and corrosivity measures and build a linear model which shows that the background environmental variables are good predictors of the water quality indices
4406,again a raster-based approach is used
4407,a further example is work by von braun # who uses pmap to look at exposure of organic and metallic compounds in groundwater in the vicinity of tucson airport arizona
4408,using plume models that predict the movement of contaminants she is able to intersect the results with data on current well locations and to assess which water supply areas are worst contaminated
4409,overlaying the results with residential location data provides maps delineating location-specific exposures for each residence in each time-period von braun # #
4410,in principle it is then possible to compare such doses with epidemiological data once again indicating a link from a hazard event to assessment of health outcomes
4411,attention should be drawn to foresman's comment that the us geological survey usgs at the eros data centre have successfully linked arc info to a model of groundwater flow foresman # #
4412,this kind of link between gis and other modelling programs is to be warmly welcomed and parallels work at the nwrrl in linking gis and air pollution plume models 
4413,natural hazards and disaster management
4414,several studies in recent papers have shown the effectiveness of gis in mitigating the effects of major natural hazards
4415,berke and ruch # for example describe a gis for assessing the impacts of hurricanes on the texas gulf coast
4416,hurricane damage through high winds and tidal surges causes an immense amount of destruction and poses a major threat to many coastal communities in the usa
4417,it has been estimated for example that during the mid # some # million us citizens were subject to hurricane winds of over # km h and # million were subject to hurricane surge brinkman #
4418,the system described by berke and ruch # is raster-based and has an interesting modelling component called slosh sea lake and overland surges from hurricanes
4419,slosh is able to estimate still water surge by grid cell for various hurricane intensities angles of approach to the shoreline forward movement speeds and landfall locations
4420,additional algorithms are used to model total building damage costs for each grid cell based on water-depth and speed-depth rating curves
4421,hobeika and jamei # describe the massevacuation massvac simulation software designed to analyse and evaluate traffic evacuation plans given a natural disaster in an urban area
4422,the system comprises three interrelated modules community and disaster type characteristics module population distribution module network evacuation module
4423,the type of natural disaster determines the time period within which the road network has to be evacuated
4424,the control and management strategies are directly correlated to each specific disaster scenario
4425,massvac is quite flexible and various user-defined road network options are available such as traffic signal timings on the road network one-way traffic reserved lanes for special vehicles such as those of the emergency services
4426,hobeika and jamei have tested massvac on various evacuation scenarios for virginia beach city in order to determine evacuation times for flood and hurricane conditions
4427,in general they suggest that the model provided reasonable and reliable evacuation times
4428,southworth # have enhanced the massvac model with the addition of a colour graphics module which they call mvopl
4429,this module has been developed using ibm's graphics kernel system and provides a number of display screens
4430,the most interesting are those which portray population flows as scaled ribbons on the network diagram and evacuation shelter capacities as bar diagrams
4431,the diagrams are updated periodically during the course of the simulation
4432,in dry parts of the world such as australia forest and bush fires are an important natural hazard and some attention has been given to the ways in which gis might help examine their potential impacts
4433,kessell # describes a pc-based gis called preplan pristine environment planning language which is a natural area management land-use planning and fire modelling system developed for the australian national parks and wildlife service preplan comprises four modules a simple raster-based gis a grid cell resource database a wide range of vegetation fuel fire behaviour erosion and land-use models tabular statistical and colour graphics output system
4434,with this system real-time fire growth can be modelled taking into account changes in terrain fuel and temporal changes in the weather
4435,kessell points out that uncontrollable fires are recurrent phenomena in many parts of australia causing damage in the hundreds of millions of dollars and significant loss of life
4436,systems such as preplan can provide the user with sound models of the behaviour patterns of fire and are therefore of enormous value in land-use planning
4437,one of the most widespread natural hazards is flooding and the potential for loss of property risk to life and general social disruption is large
4438,one interesting example of a gis approach to flood damage estimation is the anuflood package which was developed in the early # following detailed flood damage studies for flood-prone coastal towns in northern new south wales australia smith and greenaway #
4439,the anuflood system requires locational and building type data on individual properties stage-damage curves relating the average damage that would result from overfloor flooding to differing depths for each property type and lastly flood frequency in terms of flood height expressed as a probability
4440,output from the system is both tabular and graphical
4441,of particular interest is the construction of maps showing the expected annual amounts of damage for gridded flood-prone areas
4442,anuflood also contains modules which permit the investigation of various flood damage mitigation options such as property height raising levee construction and flood proofing
4443,environmental epidemiology
4444,the possibilities sketched above relate to emergency planning the search for hazardous sites and risk assessment
4445,to what extent can gis help if an event occurs
4446,what for instance of the health consequences
4447,there is a rich tradition of epidemiological work in geography and with the increasing availability of spatially referenced medical data the scope for gis applications is wide gatrell #
4448,for instance diggle # assess the hypothesis that cancer of the larynx is associated with proximity to a now-closed incinerator and develop a statistical model from the theory of spatial point processes to test this
4449,this would have been impossible without the link provided from postcoded data increasingly available from sources such as cancer registries to ordnance survey os grid references
4450,such a link is provided by the central postcode directory which matches all # million unit postcodes in the uk to grid references
4451,when the cases of laryngeal cancer are compared with a null distribution provided by the distribution of much more common lung cancer the hypothesis is given strong support
4452,although the proposed method is novel it is but one of an increasingly large number of methods designed to detect and model clusters of disease see for example cuzick and edwards #
4453,the work of diggle # examined only a single point source though it generalizes to multiple sources and to linear hazards as well
4454,as a second example of health work linked to hazard studies we may cite the research being conducted by cross # on childhood leukaemia
4455,there are numerous hypotheses concerning the aetiology of this disease from ionizing radiation to viral transmission and cross's approach is to collect digital data designed to test some of these hypotheses and to use arc info to display and analyse results
4456,for instance one hypothesis concerns the role of electromagnetic radiation a source of which is overhead high-voltage transmission lines as noted earlier
4457,if these are digitized and buffer zones constructed around them fig # we can quite easily test hypotheses about prevalence in such buffer zones as compared with prevalence outside
4458,however we should bear in mind the earlier point about the resolution of the data since such electromagnetic effects have a very weak effect beyond perhaps # m wertheimer and leeper # 
4459,there has been a suspicion for many years that high rates of stomach cancer in parts of wales may be linked to soil chemistry specifically such factors as zinc copper ratios and to lead content in water supplies
4460,matthews # has used data from the regional cancer registry morbidity rather than mortality data and data on trace elements to examine this link
4461,since the latter are available for a # km raster the registration data are assigned to these grid squares using the os grid reference
4462,as with any such study there are the usual problems of ecological analysis and influences of migration together with issues of separating out the risk factors under investigation from possible confounding factors
4463,in the usa morrill's report on the beginnings of a #m study into the possible radiation doses received as result of radiation releases by the hanford washington state nuclear complex would seem to cry out for gis skills to be applied morrill #
4464,the research project will employ plume dispersion models in order to model dispersal by wind and will need to integrate this and other environmental data with detailed demographic records
4465,to some extent this line of approach was anticipated by johnson # in his study of exposure to plutonium fall-out from the rocky flats nuclear weapons plant near denver see zeigler # ##
4466,using soil samples he constructed a contoured risk surface and then mapped excess cancers in various distance bands detecting a marked distance decay effect
4467,research problems and prospects
4468,the work reviewed above suggests that the application of gis techniques to hazard assessment emergency planning and environmental monitoring is both actually and potentially an important research area with many challenging problems
4469,undoubtedly the giss of the # will look very different from their rather primitive ancestors
4470,computer power is becoming cheaper digital data more readily available and giss are becoming hybrid systems involving other technologies
4471,in this last section we highlight some important research areas as we see them
4472,doubtless there are many others such is the surge of interest in gis technology
4473,data availability
4474,we should first consider@ the availability and quality of data concerning the populations who may be at@ risk from@ the storage and transport of hazardous substances from@ toxic air pollution from@ flooding and so on
4475,such data are crucial either for assisting the emergency services to make@ assessments@ about@ resources@ they need to deploy@ in@ such events or for high@ estimates to be made@ of risk
4476,within@ the public domain@ in the uk we must rely in general on@ data from@ the most recent population census the lowest@ level@ being that@ for enumeration districts eds
4477,as is well known rhind # these@ contain on@ average perhaps ## households and ## people
4478,the boundaries@ eds have not been widely digitized unlike the higher@ level@ electoral wards
4479,however the centroids of eds are available as # m grid@ references and artificial ed polygons can be created if necessary
4480,in@ some instances such data will suffice in@ many cases they will have to suffice as nothing better is available
4481,but in some areas eds are very extensive physical units and the shapes will be quite distorted
4482,furthermore the scales@ at@ which population estimates are often required means that even eds are too coarse@ for risk assessments@ 
4483,for instance in@ performing its quantitative risk assessments@ the health and safety executive will rarely deal@ with@ distances from hazardous sites in excess of # km petts # and census data will not offer@ sufficient resolution@ for accurate@ population estimates to be made@ 
4484,it should be pointed@ out@ however that the national radiological protection board currently uses@ # km grid@ square resolution population data from@ the # census in@ its radiological protection studies hallam #
4485,it would seem that despite the costs involved they should consider@ investing in@ the very detailed digital data pinpoint address code pac provided by pinpoint analysis ltd
4486,this@ area@ of application@ would appear to be an obvious market@ for such a product
4487,a useful research exercise@ would be to compare the use of census and pac data in@ deriving@ quantitative risk assessments@ and this@ is an interesting research problem
4488,even with@ pac data some assumptions@ would need to be made@ about@ numbers of persons per household if good population estimates were to be made@ 
4489,more generally we need to consider@ the availability of large@ databases for hazard studies and emergency planning@ and this@ is an area@ ripe@ for major initiatives
4490,in the uk we seem to be lagging@ well behind@ the usa in@ the construction@ of databases on@ hazardous sites and especially hazard events such as those@ involving toxic releases@ 
4491,for instance lioy and daisey # in@ their work on@ the monitoring of toxic air pollution in new jersey construct@ a microinventory@ for each of three towns comprising the locations of chemical plants@ metal processing plants@ paint spray manufacturers and so on
4492,some attribute information is available for these@ 
4493,more closely@ linked@ to@ gis is work by mcmaster and johnson # who perform a very detailed inventory@ of hazardous materials both stored and transported in santa monica california
4494,although the raster displays@ are very crude@ it is simple to answer spatial queries concerning the locations of people for instance particular age groups within@ certain distances of toxic hazard sites
4495,we have@ data on@ some hazardous sites eg those@ regulated@ by cimah in the uk but a much more comprehensive approach@ should be adopted@ especially if we are serious in@ the search@ for environmental associations@ with@ chronic diseases
4496,the same is true for toxic releases@ 
4497,in the usa the environmental protection agency produces@ an acute hazards events database while the department of transportation has@ a database recording@ details of # # releases@ of toxic materials such details include@ locational information type and amount of material released@ mode of release@ and resulting injuries or deaths cutter and solecki #
4498,can we not use gis technology to construct@ risk mosaics@ zeigler # at@ a variety of spatial scales@ akin to@ hewitt and burton's hazardousness of a place
4499,in the uk only a handful@ of county emergency planning@ departments cumbria for instance have built@ up@ resource@ databases in@ digital form@ and this@ needs to be promoted
4500,further@ afield@ we need to recognize@ that some disasters most obviously chernobyl will have@ implications for more than one country so that environmental monitoring should take@ place@ with@ some kind of international co-ordination@ 
4501,there will also be movements of hazardous cargoes across frontiers and there are clearly problems of risk assessment@ and planning@ for emergencies at or near international boundaries or at sea and airports
4502,as noted above@ the work of fedra # is a major step@ in@ this@ direction@ and links@ need to be forged@ between@ initiatives in the uk and the rest of europe
4503,in terms of databases on@ hazardous wastes attention has already been drawn@ to@ the waste disposal plans@ prepared@ bywras
4504,these@ give@ details of present site locations and some indication of permitted wastes though little or no information on@ closed@ and abandoned sites
4505,however for details of disposal the individual site licences must be consulted@ 
4506,the former hazardous waste inspectorate operated@ a large@ database on@ all sites with@ details of permitted wastes including allowable quantities
4507,the database was created by a commercial company aspinwalls ltd
4508,there are numerous potentially usable databases for environmental epidemiological work
4509,opcs of course is a major data repository@ for medical statistics and their various monitor series are of use though only at@ the scale@ of district health authority and above@ see gatrell and lovett # for an example
4510,regional health authorities will from time to time produce@ mortality data at@ ward level@ 
4511,however if cancers are of interest it is more appropriate to obtain@ data from@ regional cancer registries these@ data are morbidity rather than mortality data and are therefore more valuable@ 
4512,the data are postcoded and may have@ some occupational details
4513,for example we have received data from@ the regional cancer registry in manchester comprising all cancers of the larynx and lung notified between@ # and #
4514,this@ large@ data set@ to@ which grid@ references have now been added comprises information about@ nearly # # individuals
4515,it has now been copied@ into@ ingres a relational database management system@ permitting@ queries to be made@ about@ subsets@ of the data for instance all males between@ the ages of # and # suffering from@ laryngeal cancer
4516,other data sources@ on@ cancers are independent registries of malignancies
4517,an example is that@ on@ leukaemias managed by the leukaemia research fund centre@ in leeds alexander #
4518,it should be noted@ that there are frequently major discrepancies between@ the regional registries and the specialist registries partly because the latter receive@ notifications directly@ from@ consultants
4519,indeed working directly@ with consultants proves invaluable in@ gaining@ access@ to@ high@ morbidity data
4520,two other potential sources@ of data are worth@ mentioning@ 
4521,first attention should be drawn@ to@ the new directive from@ the department of health to@ regional and district health authorities to review the health of the population
4522,this@ means in@ practice that district medical officers are charged@ with@ preparing an annual report presenting@ and interpreting epidemiological data identifying local health problems and evaluating service outcomes
4523,lancaster university is already heavily@ involved in@ the work of preston district health authority in this@ area
4524,second family health service authorities fhsas are also required to take@ on@ these@ roles@ but from@ the viewpoint@ of primary health care services
4525,fhsas which correspond to@ non-metropolitan counties and to@ metropolitan boroughs hold@ large@ databases on@ services provided by general practitioners for instance uptake of immunization and screening for breast and cervical cancers
4526,is it we wonder possible to contemplate@ bringing together some of these@ data sources@ to form@ a national online health information system@ nohis to parallel@ that@ for employment and unemployment townsend #
4527,this@ might include@ data on@ morbidity and mortality uptake of preventative medicine service useand availability at@ both primary and hospital level@ 
4528,it would be a useful management tool@ particularly in view of the reorganizationtaking@ place@ in@ the national health service
4529,it should not be forgotten that hazards themselves have@ geographical distributions yet there has been little effort in the uk to develop public domain@ databases
4530,are there hazard-prone@ areas
4531,is there a regional differentiation in@ hazard type
4532,these@ are of course commercially important questions@ and a good deal@ of money is going@ into@ the collection@ of such data by insurance companies
4533,one well known database is major hazard incident data service mhidas global industrial hazards database which is currently being developed bythe safety and reliability directorate on behalf of the major hazards assessment@ unit of the uk health and safety directorate
4534,this@ system@ currently runs@ in@ dbase ii and contains@ in excess of # items@ of professionally assessed@ information on@ major hazards coded into@ some # separate fields@ 
4535,unfortunately the spatial referencing is poor@ and with@ some effort this@ could easily be remedied
4536,it is for example little usewhen recording a chemical spill into an egyptian river to have entered@ into@ the appropriate field@ the nile after@ all this@ river is some # km long
4537,here@ in@ our view@ is a classic case of the absence of a geographical input@ rendering@ the data of limited value@ 
4538,in@ some cases good hazard data exist but have simply not yet found@ their way@ into@ a gis
4539,a case in@ point@ is inland and coastal flooding
4540,most river authorities have detailed maps showing@ the geographical limits of floods in relation to their return@ periods
4541,within@ the next decade as the privatized water companies develop their gis we shall see a massive@ amount of data conversion in@ this@ area@ 
4542,this@ development together with@ the availability of digital terrain models@ will allow@ quite sophisticated@ flood forecasting models@ to be developed within@ a gis framework@ 
4543,as sea-levels rise in@ the next ## years due to the greenhouse effect this@ very practical use of gis technology is likely to become commonplace and of considerable practical importance 
4544,spatial statistics
4545,another way@ in@ which there needs to be a between@ statistical methods and gis is in@ the area@ of spatial sampling@ and estimation from@ spatial samples@ 
4546,this@ is clearly an important issue in@ radiation monitoring as the discussion@ of rimnet above@ implies@ 
4547,as an example peirson # has reviewed the evidence on@ artificial radioactivity in cumbria and shows maps of the distribution of certain radionuclides as contoured surfaces
4548,the point@ worth@ making@ here@ is that there are many alternative schemes for interpolating from@ irregular point@ data lam #
4549,one method in particular kriging now available as part@ of the uniras software offers@ not only a contoured surface but also an estimate of the standard error at any point on the map
4550,where this@ is high@ it suggests@ that an additional sampling@ station might be set up
4551,such techniques are now standard in@ environmental science see streit # for an application@ to@ rainfall monitoring and need to be promoted vigorously@ in@ hazard studies estes #
4552,related@ to@ this@ problem is that@ of making@ population estimates for new zones that result from@ overlay@ operations@ 
4553,we may want to count numbers living within@ plumes@ circles of fixed@ radius buffer zones and so on
4554,existing gis techniques usually base@ the estimates on@ area-weighted shares@ so that a new polygon created by slicing@ an existing area in@ half is assigned@ half@ the population of that@ source@ unit
4555,this@ may be quite absurd in@ some cases notably where population is spatially clustered within a physically large ed
4556,at@ the nwrrl work is under way flowerdew and green # to solve such problems using the em algorithm and the statistical modelling@ package@ glim which has been interfaced@ with@ arc info
4557,operations@ research methods and simulation
4558,while there is some research activity in@ linking@ statistical models@ to@ gis there would seem to be scope for further applications@ of operations@ research techniques to@ gis problems
4559,within@ some sophisticated@ gis such as arc info there are some useful algorithms such as shortest@ path@ calculations but gis developers have in general failed@ to realize the natural links@ between@ gis functions and many operations@ research techniques
4560,over@ the last # years or so a large@ theoretical literature has been developed to provide tools@ for the solution@ of many problems associated with@ emergency planning@ kolesar #
4561,one important class of problems is the selection of locations for the emergency service units
4562,the choice of locations need not be for permanent bases but can also include@ dynamic repositioning of units as circumstances dictate@ kolesar and walker #
4563,in@ any major emergency a typical problem is the assignment@ of resources@ to@ demands
4564,if resources@ are held@ at@ one set of locations and the demands are at@ another and the costs of transportation are known how do we allocate the resources@ most efficiently
4565,in@ a major emergency for example there might be a need to supply blood products held@ at@ regional blood banks to hospitals
4566,this@ of course is the classic transportation problem and its solution@ is well known
4567,as far@ as we know the microcomputer-based@ emergency response@ system@ devised by belardo # is the only gis-like software to incorporate this@ algorithm
4568,in@ this@ system@ the solution@ to@ the transportation problem is shown graphically on the road network which is displayed on the computer screen
4569,as a last example of the potential role@ of operations@ research in@ gis and disaster management we are reminded of the logistic problems that faced@ the peel regional police force during the mississauga evacuation mentioned@ previously scanlon and padgham #
4570,during the early states@ of the phased evacuation the logistical problem facing@ the police was the street-by-street warning of the population to make@ ready for evacuation
4571,speed was of the essence@ and manpower was limited
4572,here@ then is a familiar operations@ research network@ problem all roads have to be traversed such that the journey length time is a minimum
4573,this@ is the chinese@ postman@ problem@ which provides a hamiltonian circuit through the arcs as compared with@ the travelling@ salesman@ problem@ which is a minimum route@ through@ the network@ nodes@ 
4574,chapter nine
4575,i have@ a very important assignment for you paula arlene frampton-cox said
4576,she inserted a du maurier cigarette into her long tortoiseshell holder and sat back looking at paula who was seated in the visitor's chair on the other side of the desk long legs crossed elegantly
4577,paula looked every inch a model@ these@ days arlene thought with@ a touch@ of proprietorial@ pride
4578,her long hair shining@ gold@ was swept back and caught@ at the nape of her neck with a bow@ make-up@ expertly applied accentuated the classically beautiful lines@ of her face and she wore her well-cut suit with@ all the panache that was expected of her
4579,a good suit was a working model@'s uniform@ paula now bought two each season and wore them with perfectly matching accessories hat bag and shoes
4580,this one was in@ soft@ light@ green with a boxy@ jacket and narrow skirt and the same green-and-white check material of the little sleeveless blouse had been used to line@ the jacket and face@ the wide reveres
4581,paula's bag and shoes were patent black leather her gloves white and she carried a long walking umbrella neatly furled in its fur-trimmed case
4582,perfectly groomed@ from head to toe and with@ all that assurance she was ready to take on the world@ arlene thought with@ satisfaction for she looked@ on@ paula her very own creation@ 
4583,the raw@ materials@ might have been there before@ indeed hadn't it been she arlene who had spotted@ them
4584,but the transformation of a leggy young filly@ into@ a sleekly beautiful racehorse@ had been her doing
4585,eighteen months on@ the model@ circuit@ had eliminated@ all trace@ of her former somerset accent
4586,she had listened to@ arlene's own voice and set about imitating@ it for she held@ her mentor in@ the highest@ esteem whilst still being a little afraid of her
4587,the house of mattli is expanding@ from@ couture into@ ready-to-wear and one of the big@ bristol stores taylors are putting@ on@ a show to publicise the fact that they will be stocking the new' arlene explained
4588,i have been asked to supply@ the models@ and i would like you to be one of them@ 
4589,mattli
4590,paula repeated impressed
4591,the house of mattli was a husband and wife team who were numbered amongst@ the top@ ten names in@ the incorporated society of london fashion designers
4592,furthermore madame mattli was a frenchwoman an accident of birth which added to@ her glamour for was not paris the fashion capital@ of the world
4593,madame mattli will be coming to bristol herself arlene continued
4594,taylors have a certain amount of stock but she will be bringing extra samples from london especially for the show
4595,i only want the best of my girls on@ this@ job
4596,madame mattli remember is used to@ the best
4597,we can't afford@ any sloppiness
4598,i can count on@ you paula i feel@ sure
4599,oh yes paula said brimming@ with@ suppressed@ excitement
4600,you can count on@ me
4601,madame mattli was almost exactly as paula had imagined she would be a petite perfectly turned out woman with@ an air@ of chic that was unmistakably french
4602,her dark@ grey-streaked@ hair which she wore in@ a long bob had been cut by vidal sassoon and she wore a beautifully tailored black suit relieved@ only by a little white flounce at the neckline
4603,in the fitting rooms at taylors she fussed and fretted over@ her creations@ a mother@ hen@ and though paula was overawed by the great designer she also liked her on@ sight
4604,madame mattli might be a stickler for detail with@ a generous@ helping@ of the artistic temperament which kept her tight-coiled@ a spring@ and which would explode@ into@ frenzy if the smallest detail was not as it should be but she also had a kind@ face and deep@ perceptive@ eyes
4605,half way through@ the day's programme of shows while the dressers went off to grab a sandwich and the model girls who would not dare to eat while they were showing revived@ themselves with cups of black coffee madame mattli took paula to one side
4606,little one i would like to speak with you
4607,paula's stomach turned@ a somersault@ 
4608,had she done something wrong
4609,i have been watching you work madame mattli said directly@ 
4610,her accent reminded paula of louise perhaps that@ was why she warmed@ to@ her in spite of the fact that she was so awe-inspiring
4611,you are exactly right for a couture model@ 
4612,you have all the physical attributes 
4613,thank you paula said faintly
4614,madame mattli waved a dismissive@ hand
4615,do not thank me
4616,i am not saying this@ to make@ your head swell@ 
4617,on@ the contrary
4618,the fact is that i have@ a vacancy arising@ for a couture model@ 
4619,i believe you are exactly what i am looking@ for
4620,i would like you to come to london to work for me
4621,over madame mattli's shoulder paula could see arlene watching her a tiny smile lifting@ one corner@ of her scarlet mouth and paula knew her well enough by now to know exactly what she was thinking
4622,she did not want to lose@ paula who was one of her best models@ but already she was enjoying the reflected@ glory@ that came@ from@ having personally trained a house model@ for one of the great london couture houses
4623,she had known about@ the vacancy at mattli and hoped that the job might be offered to@ paula
4624,it was the seal@ of approval for her own judgement
4625,well
4626,madame mattli demanded
4627,can i have@ a little time to think it over
4628,paula asked boldly
4629,a little
4630,but please do not delay too long
4631,my present@ house model@ leaves at@ the end@ of the month and there are plenty of girls who would jump@ at@ the chance
4632,i'm sure
4633,but all the same i couldn't make@ such a move@ without@ giving@ it some thought paula said grandly
4634,but inside she was bubbling@ with@ excitement
4635,time to think
4636,she didn't need a single second
4637,the moment madame mattli had offered her the job she had made@ up@ her mind
4638,she was going to take@ it of course
4639,a month later paula smartly dressed in a new tweed suit with the obligatory matching bag and shoes and lugging both her modelling@ case and a brand new cream leather suitcase took@ the train to london to begin her new career
4640,she had booked herself a bed at a ywca hostel for the time being
4641,it was not quite what she envisaged for herself but it had@ the advantage of being cheap and it went@ some way@ towards@ satisfying grace who was convinced that london was a den@ of iniquity waiting@ to swallow up her unsuspecting daughter
4642,from the hostel it was only a short tube ride to south audley street where madame mattli had her showrooms yet another advantage paula thought trying to weigh up the points@ in favour of the hostel which she hated on@ sight
4643,sharing a small spartan room with two other girls northerners whose accent paula found@ almost incomprehensible and with@ whom she had nothing in common making breakfast in the communal kitchen queuing for the bath adhering@ to@ a strict@ curfew after@ which time the doors were locked and bolted none of these@ were restrictions paula had@ the slightest@ intention of enduring for long
4644,but for now it would have to do
4645,and at least she was in london centre@ of the british fashion industry@ 
4646,as for the house of mattli it might have been in@ a different world@ to@ the hostel with@ its air@ of being a cross@ between@ a workhouse@ and a boarding@ school@ 
4647,the first time she rang the bell and went in through the front doors of the elegant old house where the showrooms were situated mattli had@ no rear entrance paula felt she was stepping into@ the place of her dreams@ 
4648,deep@ carpet covered the floors and the stairs swept@ up to the showrooms and the warren@ of workrooms beyond and though the window drapes and furnishings were ever-so-slightly faded@ as if they had seen@ better days they were of the finest silks and velvets and every corner was swept polished and cleaned daily so that no single speck of dust let alone a cobweb dared@ show@ itself
4649,the showroom was neither large nor small decorated in@ muted shades@ of aubergine which would not detract from@ the clothes
4650,there was a low table and three or four dainty chairs with aubergine velvet seats and gilded spindle legs@ 
4651,the crystal chandelier was for effect only lighting that would show off the clothes to@ their best advantage was brilliant yet discreet@ and along one wall were racks holding some of the ready-to-wear garments
4652,in@ contrast to@ this@ elegant frontage the workrooms beyond were a hive@ of frenzied activity
4653,pattern cutters fitters sewing hands and their assistants all worked at@ an incredible speed
4654,this@ paula soon discovered@ was the way@ of the fashion world@ a constant@ frantic rush against@ the clock to have collections ready@ on@ time or to complete individual couture garments for customers who always considered their order@ more urgent more important than that@ of anyone else
4655,paula was amazed by the security arrangements that were necessary to ensure that the new season's collections remained exclusive the windows at the rear of the premises were heavily barred and practically the first thing@ she had to do on@ commencing her employment@ was to sign a contract promising that she would not breathe@ a word about@ the designs she saw 
4656,on@ her second day madame mattli took her to vidal sassoon's salon in grosvenor house so that her hair could be cut in@ an up-to-the-minute style
4657,unlike some couturiers madame did not mind if her model@ girls did not have the same colour hair but she did insist on@ identical styles
4658,by@ the time vidal sassoon had finished with@ her paula's long fair@ locks had been shorn to@ a sharp@ geometric shape and she scarcely recognised the reflection that looked@ back@ at her from the mirror
4659,among the rich and famous who had come to the salon to have@ their hair cut tinted and set paula recognised dusty springfield the pop singer her eyes big and sooty@ her lips pearly pink and was unable to suppress@ the thrill of excitement which ran@ through@ her
4660,this@ was her very first taste@ of only the best being good enough and she liked it
4661,it was paula's job to show samples parading slowly up@ and down@ in front of the clients as they sat on the elegant spindle-leg chairs taking@ in@ every detail of the garments with@ a critical@ and practised@ eye
4662,sometimes they came alone sometimes with a man in@ tow@ to foot@ the bill@ 
4663,paula guessed
4664,the appearance of a famous face in the show rooms always caused a stir@ amongst@ the girls who all longed to hook@ a wealthy husband and if he had@ a title like the aly khan or was a film star like omar shariff then so much the better
4665,not everything that paula had to do was quite so glamorous however
4666,in@ the long@ hours when there were no customers to show she was expected to lend@ a hand@ with@ some of the unskilled tasks running@ errands and making tea unpicking a seam or a hem even sewing on a button or a hook and eye when she had been taught the proper way@ to do it
4667,paula was not very clever with@ her needle but she soon learned to be careful so as not to incur the wrath of the seamstress
4668,there were new tricks of modelling@ to be learned too how to remove a coat sliding it carefully off her shoulders with@ the sleeves hanging in@ perfect balance never for one moment allowing the inside to be on@ view for samples were often unlined
4669,this@ trick@ took@ hours of practice up@ and down@ the landing at the hostel while the other girls looked at her she had taken@ leave@ of her senses@ 
4670,although she enjoyed her job paula was lonely
4671,even the most popular of girls soon discovered that in@ this@ highly competitive world@ where models@ vied with@ one another for the most glamorous jobs and the wealthiest and best-looking men there was far more bitchiness than in the provinces and paula was far from popular
4672,the other girls disliked her for her outstanding looks and her haughty ways@ and made@ no attempt to be friendly on@ anything but the most superficial level@ and the pattern cutters and sewing hands hurried home to their families and boyfriends the moment they finished their long@ day's work
4673,paula spent@ most of her free@ time alone window shopping visiting news theatres where she sometimes watched the programme of cartoons twice round@ and drinking endless cups of espresso coffee in cafs and coffee houses
4674,her favourite was the coffee shop in fenwicks in bond street for this@ was the haunt and the meeting place of all those@ from the world@ of fashion
4675,one lunchtime when she had been at the house of mattli for a few months paula went there for her usual coffee and the cottage cheese salad that was her staple diet now that it was so important that she did not add a single half-inch to her wand-@ figure
4676,she took her tray to the pay desk opened her bag and felt for her purse
4677,it was not there
4678,frantically she rooted@ round then checked her pockets without@ success
4679,i'm sorry
4680,i seem to have lost my purse she explained
4681,the girl behind the till stared at her stonily
4682,paula was going hot and cold by now
4683,had it been stolen
4684,no she remembered her bag tipping over in the cloakroom at mattli it must have fallen out then
4685,but without it she could not pay for her coffee and salad
4686,having@ trouble a voice beside her asked@ 
4687,don't worry@ 
4688,let me
4689,paula turned gratefully then gasped with@ surprise as she recognised the slight figure in black roll-neck sweater and skin tight pants
4690,i don't believe it
4691,gary oliver
4692,what are you doing here
4693,the same as you i expect paula getting@ my strength up@ to face@ the rest of the day
4694,let me pay and then we'll have lunch together and do some catching@ up@ unless you're meeting someone of course
4695,no no i'm not
4696,paula picked up her try and moved aside waiting for him flushed with@ pleasure at@ seeing a familiar face
4697,gary oliver was a designer young and very talented
4698,she had met him back@ home@ in the west country when he had come to supervise a show put@ on@ by one of the big@ ready-to-wear labels carnega for whom he worked as a junior@ member@ of the design@ team
4699,for a whole@ week they had worked closely@ together sharing flasks of coffee and packets of cigarettes and paula had grown@ to like the pixie@ little man who by his very nature@ offered@ her no challenge@ and no threat@ 
4700,gary should have been a girl she had thought for he was half a head smaller than she was with fair@ curling hair baby-blue eyes and long thick lashes that were the envy of every woman who met him
4701,shall we sit over there in the corner
4702,gary suggested
4703,he led the way his slim hips in the tight fitting pants snaking gracefully between the tables
4704,they unloaded@ their trays on to a table
4705,what are you doing in london then paula
4706,apart from mislaying your purse i mean
4707,he grinned at@ her impishly
4708,she told him
4709,and what about@ you
4710,aren't you with@ carnega any more
4711,he shook his head
4712,dimples played@ in his cheeks
4713,no now i'm with@ the house of oliver
4714,the house of oliver
4715,oh she squealed as light@ dawned@ 
4716,your house 
4717,you've set@ up@ as a designer in@ your own right@ gary
4718,yep
4719,in@ a small@ way@ at@ the moment of course but things@ are happening
4720,i came@ into@ a bit@ of money when my grandmother died and i decided to put@ it to@ good use
4721,isn't it a bit@ of a risk
4722,paula asked
4723,he shrugged his narrow shoulders
4724,perhaps
4725,but i wanted to work for myself
4726,designing clothes for carnega was all very well and i made@ a good living at@ it i won't deny but i wanted to be free to do my own thing@ and to have@ my own name on the labels
4727,i have@ quite a few contacts@ people who knew me when i was designing for carnega and they have been very encouraging
4728,so i have decided to move to london and open@ a showroom
4729,in@ fact i have just been looking at@ a place in south audley street not far from mattli
4730,if it worksoutwe shall practically@ be neighbours paula
4731,what a small world
4732,i had@ no idea paula said surprised she had not already heard the news
4733,usually the slightest@ whisper travelled@ jungle@ drums@ through@ the world@ of fashion
4734,until@ now gary had been an out-of-town designer of course
4735,but if he was moving@ to london his new fashion house would soon be a talking point
4736,we must keep@ in@ touch@ gary said as he finished his cheese roll
4737,promise you'll look in and say hello when you have@ time
4738,i will
4739,apart from anything else i owe@ you a coffee
4740,true
4741,i don't suppose i could persuade you to work for me in@ return@ 
4742,i'm looking@ for a couple of good models@ 
4743,though i don't suppose i could afford to pay you as well as mattli does yet
4744,maybe one day
4745,paula laughed
4746,i don't earn that@ much
4747,by@ the time i've paid for my room at the ywca and bought all the make-up and clothes i need there never seems to be anything left over@ 
4748,i'm looking@ for a rich husband to take@ me away from@ it all
4749,and i'm sure one day you'll find him
4750,in@ the meantime don't forget your friends eh paula
4751,i won't she promised glancing at@ her watch
4752,oh hell@ i shall have to go
4753,me too
4754,but it was great@ to see you again paula
4755,they walked back@ to south audley street together weaving@ their way through the lunchtime crowds on the pavements the tall striking girl and the young man whose pixie@ looks@ belied his twenty-six years
4756,outside the front entrance of the house of mattli paula turned to give@ him a quick@ impulsive hug
4757,thanks for the lunch gary
4758,and good luck with@ your new venture
4759,she held up her fingers tightly@ crossed for him
4760,he grinned
4761,i'll need it
4762,don't forget to come and see me will you
4763,i shall be expecting you
4764,i won't forget
4765,'bye for now she called and ran in through the imposing front door
4766,madame mattli was furious
4767,in@ all the time she had been with@ her paula had never seen her so angry
4768,i hear you have been seen going into the house of oliver she said her immaculately@ painted@ lips tight@ with@ fury
4769,beside her monsieur mattli a small greek-looking man some ten years her senior was also quivering with@ indignation
4770,not once but several times he added@ 
4771,it was so unusual for him to contribute@ anything to@ the conversation that paula glanced at@ him in@ surprise
4772,though he was always in@ evidence@ it was invariably madame who did all the talking giving@ orders@ fussing around clients so that paula was never quite certain what his role@ was
4773,gary oliver is a friend she said defensively@ 
4774,madame mattli snorted angrily
4775,i do not pay you to have@ friends in@ rival fashion houses 
4776,he's not a rival
4777,paula broke@ off@ 
4778,it seemed ridiculous that a newcomer like gary could be any threat@ to@ a well-established house like mattli
4779,but in@ the cut-throat world@ of fashion up and coming designers were to be feared and already gary's reputation was growing@ 
4780,you know that we insist on@ complete@ loyalty madame mattli continued
4781,the security of our designs@ is paramount
4782,oh paula how could you
4783,but i would never mention anything i have seen here
4784,paula protested
4785,madame snorted again
4786,how can i be sure of that@ 
4787,even if you do not intend to be disloyal there is always the risk that you might be careless
4788,pillow talk is the most dangerous
4789,pillow talk
4790,paula repeated stunned@ 
4791,close@ though her friendship with@ gary had become she had never once breathed@ a word to@ him about@ the new collections she saw taking@ shape@ at mattli and as for pillow talk the notion was absurd
4792,there was nothing like that@ between@ them and never would be
4793,gary was not interested in@ girls
4794,surely that@ must be obvious to@ everyone who met him
4795,you must stop visiting him madame said firmly@ 
4796,either i have@ your word@ on@ it or i am afraid you can no longer remain in@ my employ
4797,i want you to promise me here and now that you will not see gary oliver again
4798,paula was trembling
4799,her job with@ the house of mattli was her life@ 
4800,but to allow herself to be dictated@ to@ in@ this@ way@ when she knew she had done nothing wrong was tantamount to@ admitting@ guilt
4801,and she couldn't bear@ the thought of being sucked@ back@ into@ the ebb@ tide@ of loneliness again either
4802,with@ gary she enjoyed@ a relationship she had never experienced with@ anyone else the easy-going friendship of a male who made@ no demands whatever on@ her and it meant@ more to@ her than she had realised
4803,i have never betrayed@ any confidence and i never will
4804,but you can't expect me to cut@ myself off@ from@ my friends she said
4805,i am afraid i do expect it paula in@ this@ case
4806,i can't promise not to see gary again
4807,very well
4808,there was a hint@ of sadness now in madame's eyes but her mouth was set@ and determined@ 
4809,i shall be sorry to lose@ you paula
4810,you are a good model@ and you suited@ me very well
4811,but you leave@ me no choice
4812,please do not bother to come in again
4813,i shall contact the agency for a replacement immediately@ 
4814,and i warn you if any of my designs@ or anything like them turn@ up@ in the showroom at the house of oliver i shall sue and win the sort of damages@ that will put@ your little friend out of@ business for good
4815,do i make@ myself clear@ 
4816,paula was still afraid of madame mattli and she was also close@ to@ tears
4817,but she was determined madame should not be aware of either
4818,yes madame
4819,i'm sorry to leave@ you but i assure you you need not worry@ on@ that@ score@ 
4820,the showrooms of the house of oliver were smaller and less grand than those@ at the house of mattli but the dcor was newer and fresher@ pale@ grey drapes ultra modern black furniture and a great deal@ of gleaming stainless steel
4821,gary was in the workroom when paula arrived pinning a length of vibrant@ pink chiffon sarong-style around one of his models@ 
4822,his mouth was full of pins
4823,what are you doing here he asked without@ moving his lips
4824,paula perched@ herself against the cutting table trying@ to look nonchalant
4825,i've left@ mattli she said
4826,gary stared at@ her for a moment pins spewing@ from his mouth and catching@ on the front of his black jersey
4827,then he unpinned the length of chiffon and let it fall to the floor
4828,the model@ stood motionless clad in nothing but her bra and stockings waiting for his instructions
4829,we'll leave@ this@ for now claudia he said
4830,see@ if you can rustle up a cup of tea for paula and me please
4831,the girl pulled on her wrap and moved to the door looking back over her shoulder as she went and paula was aware of the hostility in@ her gaze
4832,why was it all women hated her so even when they didn't know her
4833,she shrugged
4834,oh well she should be used to@ it by now
4835,gary got up took paula by the arm and led her over to the low sofa
4836,what's all this@ about@ lovey
4837,you can't have left@ mattli
4838,i have
4839,paula related@ what had happened and saw gary turn pale
4840,oh lord
4841,you mean she thinks you've been spying for me
4842,if she sues i'll be ruined@ 
4843,even worse someone of her stature@ could make@ a hell@ of a lot of trouble for me even if she doesn't
4844,but gary i haven't been spying for you
4845,i haven't even mentioned a single detail of the mattli collection
4846,you know that@ and so do i but suppose i've done something similar
4847,it happens every season by sheer@ chance and law@ of averages some of the ideas are bound@ to come@ up@ 
4848,there are always accusations of piracy@ and copy-catting though they can't usually be substantiated
4849,but if she can prove that you and i
4850,that@'s nonsense
4851,we haven't done anything wrong
4852,gary ran@ a distracted@ hand through his mop@ of fair@ hair
4853,you're going to have to describe the mattli collection to@ me
4854,every detail
4855,gary she objected shocked@ 
4856,you're an original@ 
4857,you can't steal@ their ideas
4858,no idiot not so that i can steal@ them
4859,so that i can go@ through@ my designs@ and make@ quite certain that there is not one collar not one cuff detail not the slightest@ influence that they could accuse me of copying@ from@ them
4860,oh jesus christ suppose there's something major
4861,my peg topevening gown my beautiful cerise lace i could end up having to rethink the whole@ collection
4862,for goodness sake stop panicking
4863,paula said though she could feel the seeds@ of panic herself
4864,i'm sure there's nothing to worry@ about@ 
4865,i only hope you're right he said in@ anguished@ tones
4866,the model@ came in with the cups of tea still glowering darkly@ at@ paula from@ beneath her fringe of false@ eyelashes
4867,it was clear@ she was blaming paula bitterly for the interrupted@ afternoon and her boss's drastic change of mood
4868,that girl is a dog@ 
4869,paula said when they were alone again
4870,i'm sure she can't do justice@ to@ your designs@ 
4871,and with@ a miserable@ face like hers i'm surprised you ever get@ any work done at all
4872,gary looked crestfallen
4873,she's the best i could get
4874,oh what rubbish@ 
4875,paula said roundly
4876,anyway you've got me now so you can get@ rid@ of her
4877,what do you mean
4878,gary asked
4879,he looked like a worried small boy
4880,i told you i've left@ mattli
4881,i'll come and work for you
4882,oh paula
4883,gary's expression@ became even more anxious
4884,you know i'd give my right arm to have@ someone as good as you to model@ for me
4885,but i told you before@ i couldn't afford to pay you what you're worth
4886,well not for ages anyway
4887,it's going to be a long@ struggle@ getting established and until@ i am i don't see@ how
4888,paula smiled
4889,for the first time she felt the stirrings@ of something like power@ 
4890,it was not unlike the feeling she experienced when men looked at@ her and wanted her though she knew it could not be that@ for there was nothing sexual between@ her and gary and never would be
4891,but it was just as exciting nevertheless
4892,it made@ her feel strong@ invincible almost and just a tiny bit she had drunk@ too much wine@ 
4893,her smile spread@ 
4894,grant's remains were shovelled into a canvas bag
4895,tense@ facing outwards forster lawton and nell guarded delaney as he intoned the seaman's prayer of interment and then committed@ the canvas bag to@ the ocean
4896,the storm was abating rapidly the evening sky clearing@ in@ the west with@ the golden@ rays of the setting@ sun adding@ a dying@ colour to@ the sullen@ slate blue water
4897,the whiteness of the canvas body-bag dimmed@ beneath the onrushing sea faded@ at the edges then grew smaller greener and was gone@ 
4898,they returned to the bridge fearful of every dark place every corner every door
4899,the gangway lamps seemed to give@ no light only add@ further to@ the gloom of the dusk
4900,back@ in the wheelhouse delaney faced them
4901,right
4902,you all know the score@ 
4903,as i see@ it we've got@ two choices
4904,one we get out of here now
4905,launch the lifeboat take@ our chances or two we go after@ whatever it is
4906,nobody spoke immediately
4907,finally forster glanced at@ lawton for support@ and drawled laconically
4908,i'm not leaving here until we've done@ for that@ bastard@ 
4909,it's personal from now on in@ 
4910,lawton nodded his agreement
4911,yes he said i feel@ the same
4912,nell
4913,delaney asked looking at@ her squarely
4914,i agree she said without@ hesitation
4915,their tense@ edgy@ faces watched@ delaney closely@ 
4916,we don't know what we're up@ against@ delaney said so let's proceed@ with@ maximum caution 
4917,trouble is lawton said with@ a frown there aren't enough of us to search the ship
4918,it can work@ its way@ past us and hide again
4919,we could still be looking for it when they blow@ us out of the water
4920,that@'s why we've got to take@ risks nell put@ in@ 
4921,lure@ it into@ a trap@ somehow
4922,and quickly
4923,forster's chuckle was mirthless
4924,i don't think this@ joker@ is going to need much encouragement
4925,no
4926,delaney was momentarily thoughtful
4927,what had@ you in@ mind nell
4928,she pointed to the figure of a man propped in the corner and the cylinders of oxygen in the back pack lying@ beside it
4929,two of our number have been killed
4930,each time when they were on@ their own
4931,let's give@ it the same conditions only this@ time we use as the bait@ 
4932,they looked at@ the man@ forster had found
4933,it was a safety suit an advanced model of the nbc type with its own oxygen tanks
4934,one in@ ambush with@ the rest of us acting beaters@ 
4935,start at one end of the ship making@ as much noise as possible
4936,forster grunted
4937,it had@ no trouble finding grant
4938,i think it's a good idea
4939,and i'll go in the suit until we reach@ the ambush point@ 
4940,might help to draw@ it
4941,they helped him kit up nell connecting the leads@ from the back pack into the suit attachments
4942,forster's breathing whistled@ out of the one-way valve
4943,behind the clear wide vizor he tried to smile
4944,cosy in here he joked
4945,even got my own toilet
4946,bloody handy@ in@ the circumstances
4947,delaney took@ the lead
4948,it was now light the lamps on the gangway giving@ murky@ yellow pools@ that barely pushed@ back@ the inky@ blackness of a starless night
4949,at the entrance to the laboratory complex the others drew on their own masks
4950,ineffectual or not against@ lingering gases it seemed a wise@ precaution even if it was only psychological
4951,delaney glanced back at@ them
4952,let's make@ sure it knows@ where we are
4953,they made@ noise slammed doors
4954,nell shuddered
4955,were unseen eyes watching them
4956,was it even now shadowing@ them moving soundlessly from cover to cover a tiger@ in@ the steel@ jungle@ 
4957,forster's radio-projected@ voice broke@ into@ her thoughts
4958,looks a good place
4959,he was at the entrance to the secure@ lab zone 
4960,this must be the only way in nell said
4961,forster was quickly de-suited
4962,as they set up the now empty suit with@ its back@ to@ the door half slumped@ over a control panel he settled down behind the curtained entrance of the showers
4963,delaney's voice was hushed
4964,maybe we should leave two of us here
4965,don't want to rouse@ any suspicions
4966,forster was adamant
4967,after@ all it might be able@ to count
4968,when he didn't get@ any response he patted the uzi beside him on the steel floor
4969,i won't be unprepared like poor@ old@ grant
4970,delaney pulled the curtain across covering forster who cut a small slit in the opaque green plastic widening it to give@ himself a better field@ of view
4971,lawton came and crouched down in front of it
4972,i've left@ the suit's radio on@ full@ he said
4973,make@ it sound interesting if we talk occasionally
4974,he hesitated
4975,good luck
4976,i feel a maharajah@ waiting@ for the tiger@ to pounce@ on@ the tied-@ up@ goat@ forster grinned
4977,i hope i don't have to wait all night
4978,nell shuddered
4979,night
4980,this@ was a night in@ their minds a creature from@ the darker@ side@ of man's intellect
4981,something worried her about@ that@ thought
4982,something hidden@ behind@ the more obvious sentiment
4983,after they'd gone forster felt@ the silence settle@ around@ him
4984,he'd never been one to exercise@ an over-@ yet the conditions were the feeling@ of a tomb@ of an interment@ 
4985,would he be found he mused a thousand years from@ then a dust-covered skeleton
4986,he chuckled
4987,and the uzi a primitive@ weapon the bio suit ceremonial@ armour@ 
4988,the first stunning silence gave@ way@ to@ the creaking of the ship and a far-off booming of the sea against the hull
4989,the radio on the dummy@ suddenly screeched@ into@ action@ as delaney's distorted voice gave@ it life@ 
4990,the thousands of tons of steel made@ real communication impossible
4991,his own radio was off@ 
4992,forster settled down only putting his eye to the slit every half@ minute not continually as he had started to do
4993,he had@ a good view of the long shadowy main corridor
4994,the only problem was if he corrected@ himself it came which side turning if any would it use@ 
4995,the further away the better
4996,the more time to see it approach 
4997,the trouble was the transverse corridor just outside the room
4998,if the approach was that@ way he would get@ no warning at all and it would be on top of@ george his name for the dummy@ sitting@ a drunken@ son-of-a-bitch@ before he knew it
4999,if that@ happened he'd have to work fast
5000,what he'd seen done to@ grant made@ forster realise that whatever it was struck with@ demonic speed and savagery
5001,in@ seconds poor@ old@ george would be spread around the room an explosion@ in@ harrod@'s@ window@ and the thing would be away
5002,or on@ him
5003,as if in@ protest george uttered@ a blood-curdling lunatic-sounding cackle@ and fell fractionally forward
5004,forster suppressed a nervous@ giggle
5005,they reached@ the main deck dropping down
5006,in@ a defensive posture eyes searching@ the stacked containers trying to probe@ the black jagged@ recesses@ between them
5007,lawton scanned upwards
5008,it could be anywhere
5009,even back@ on the bridge again
5010,we should start in the engine room nell suggested shivering work up@ through the crew's quarters and then into the complex
5011,confronted@ with@ the need to proceed 
5012,delaney took@ risks plummeting feet first through the hatchways and partly breaking@ his descent with@ the handrails falling a parachutist@ rolling instantly deploying his uzi against@ 
5013,against@ what
5014,like forster all he could guess was that it was fast
5015,grant may have been lame but fast or silent
5016,or both
5017,the speed of descent must have cut@ down@ the exposure to@ any residual gas since he felt@ none of the earlier weirdness as he approached the still sealed engine room door
5018,pandora@'s box@ 
5019,he winced at@ the memory as he hammered on the steel and then looked through the spy@ port@ 
5020,in@ the stroboscopic@ view the giant pistons were the only things moving until a figure detached itself from the wall its grey colour exactly that@ of the background steel
5021,a chameleon@ it moved out of the aisle between machines then stopped and became utterly motionless
5022,delaney's stillness caught@ the attention of the others
5023,nell's transceivered@ voice crackled in his headphones
5024,what is it
5025,he didn't want to take@ his eyes from@ it equally he wanted somebody else to see it
5026,to confirm 
5027,gently@ as though he might disturb it he pulled back
5028,take@ a look for yourself
5029,she did and caught@ her breath
5030,the creature was large-headed absurdly so its body half man half something lost@ in@ the primordial past 
5031,but there could be no doubt that fundamentally it was human
5032,nell knew and not only because she was a female of the same species
5033,she could see in its eyes intelligence
5034,and human fear
5035,but also as a doctor she knew exactly what it was
5036,she told delaney who shook his head with@ revulsion
5037,nell would never rest until she could get closer to confirm her worst suspicions and paradoxically it was the woman in@ her that provided the intensity of emotion that would let nothing stand@ in@ her way@ 
5038,george the sacrificial dummy@ hadn't emitted a squeak for a long@ time
5039,forster scanned the corridor once more
5040,it was empty
5041,just as it always had been
5042,he sat back again eyeing the blank wall before him confident that he'd catch it however good it was
5043,he kept wondering how it had got@ silk
5044,silk was the meanest toughest@ professional he'd ever known
5045,and yet he'd disappeared without@ trace
5046,forster was a fatalist
5047,he shrugged
5048,you could be james bond he thought but if something had@ your number@ on@ it
5049,a gentle@ breeze broke@ the absolute silence moving the curtain so that he had to steady it with his hand
5050,instantly alert forster checked through his spy@ port@ 
5051,nothing
5052,but a door had opened somewhere
5053,somebody or something had entered the complex
5054,it could be the others returning or the start of his ambush
5055,for god's sake leave your mask on
5056,and that@'s an order
5057,but delaney's plea was in vain
5058,nell pulled it off got close to the door and shouted
5059,we mean you no harm
5060,you can help us
5061,when she checked through the spyhole it was standing in exactly the same spot@ unmoving a lizard@ 
5062,lawton shook his head
5063,can't hear you
5064,try the ship's system again
5065,nell ran to the wall telephone and pushed the digit for engine room
5066,the small light beneath the receiver@ rests showed@ that the line@ was working@ 
5067,worried delaney followed searching@ her face fearing the tell-tale signs@ of toxicity
5068,on@ impulse and against@ his better judgment he pulled off his own mask
5069,nell repeatedly pressed the button shouted across at@ lawton who was now using the spy@ port@ 
5070,what's happening
5071,the back@ of lawton's head shook his radio-projected@ voice crackling
5072,nothing now
5073,the head jerked@ just the once to the left so i reckon@ it heard the phone
5074,he straightened up and came over directing@ his question at@ delaney
5075,we ought to get on 
5076,delaney nodded his agreement
5077,leave it nell
5078,his tone was sharp@ 
5079,it's not going anywhere
5080,she squared@ up to@ him defiantly
5081,i can't john
5082,don't you see@ 
5083,the poor@ thing is part@ of this@ madness
5084,if we can get to it i can learn so much more
5085,and in@ any case it might die if we don't try and help it soon
5086,delaney averted@ his gaze from@ her afraid of what he had seen in her eyes
5087,perhaps it would be better if it did
5088,you don't mean that@ she said stepping away from him
5089,delaney fiddled@ awkwardly with his mask preparatory to@ putting it back on again
5090,for god's sake nell
5091,all i mean is we've got@ a job@ to do
5092,and forster's neck@'s on@ the line@ 
5093,don't you owe@ it to@ him to come now
5094,she flushed@ but held on@ to@ the phone 
5095,obviously striving to be as controlled@ as possible she smiled
5096,you two can manage@ she said calmly
5097,i can do better here on@ my own
5098,quietly
5099,if i succeed it will unlock@ a lot@ of the mystery of what's been done on@ titron
5100,and
5101,she faltered
5102, i think we owe@ it to@ that pathetic creature in there
5103,pathetic
5104,delaney tried to play down the fear in@ his voice fear for her
5105,it might be bloody dangerous
5106,certainly something on this ship is
5107,not this one nell said shaking her head with@ some kind of reassurance
5108,i just know
5109,lawton gestured in the gangway
5110,you may not be at@ risk from@ what is in here
5111,what about@ out there
5112,there's no guarantee that what we're hunting is going to follow@ the rules@ 
5113,nell shrugged
5114,that@'s a risk i'll have to take@ 
5115,i've got@ a more important job@ here 
5116,delaney knew there was no way@ she would be shifted@ from@ her chosen course@ 
5117,ordering her would be ludicrous under@ the changed circumstances and in@ any event a waste@ of time
5118,but lawton was right
5119,the risk from@ the other danger or dangers of titron frightened him more
5120,help me secure@ the stairs behind us he snapped@ at@ lawton as much as we can
5121,delaney turned to nell
5122,it might buy@ you the time you need
5123,but take@ care
5124,don't be bloody foolish like i am leaving you here
5125,establish contact@ if you can
5126,no more at@ this@ stage@ 
5127,understand
5128,and don't try and get the door open
5129,but nell was hardly listening
5130,to please him she nodded then despite lawton's presence squeezed delaney's arm
5131,and you
5132,she smiled
5133,watch out
5134,reluctantly delaney made@ for the gangway
5135,lawton had already shifted some chairs in@ readiness to form a barricade
5136,he gave@ him a hand with@ a large oil drum@ and then another as nell tearing@ herself from@ her appointed task dragged over a bench
5137,as they drew back up the stairs piling on the pieces she threw up at them lawton sniffed
5138,this won't hold@ anything
5139,just slow it down 
5140,like forster before@ her nell indicated her pistol and grenades
5141,as long as there's ti me that's all we need
5142,as they descended the stairs delaney paused and took@ a last look down at@ her
5143,she smiled shyly then turned away
5144,in@ a sense as long as he could convince himself that she was safe he was glad she wasn't coming with them
5145,whatever it was they were after@ it was an unknown quantity unknown that is except for a lethal ferocity
5146,he pulled on his respirator his mind made@ up@ to get backto her as soon as he could for nell anderson was all he cared about@ now
5147,there it went again
5148,forster frowned as he looked through his spy hole
5149,a sound
5150,he couldn't place@ it but it reminded him strongly@ of something
5151,the corridor was empty
5152,it had happened three times now
5153,a hissing we gas escaping@ ending with@ a funny@ little@ squeak
5154,he looked at@ george wondering if the sound had come@ from him
5155,satisfied that everything was as it should be he checked his watch
5156,well over@ half@ an hour had passed@ 
5157,they ought to be near him soon
5158,forster searched in a pouch and came up with a glucose sweet
5159,quietly he unwrapped the covering paper then paused as some instinct made@ him check again
5160,as he did so the sound came@ nearer louder
5161,his intense scrutiny took@ in@ the shadowy and empty lengths of the corridor
5162,apart from some dark@ patches@ on the wall that he hadn't noticed before@ there was nothing to see
5163,his gaze came@ back@ to@ george still sprawled over the control desk
5164,a fly landed on the empty staring@ vizor and crawled across it
5165,forster was sorely tempted to nip@ out and confirm that the noise was coming@ from george by twiddling the volume and tuner but fought@ down@ the urge
5166,he sat back pulled off his mask and popped@ the sweet into his mouth
5167,it took@ him only seconds to notice the smell
5168,forster choked as the putrefying reek seemed to get right into him
5169,frightened that it was a gas pocket@ he fumbled with his mask and finally got it back@ on
5170,his heart was thumping
5171,nothing seemed to be happening all his senses were apparently functioning normally except that the sweet in his mouth seemed permeated with@ the awful smell had become a slimy lump of filth
5172,he had to get rid of it
5173,forster reached for his mask just as the hissing@ gas noise sounded right on top of@ him ending with@ a little@ shriek
5174,he knew then where he'd heard something similar before@ 
5175,it was like a man breathing through a respiratory system with some sort of one-way valve
5176,a shadow fell@ across the wall opposite as slowly and fearfully he turned
5177,the curtain was a dense@ opaque greenish-yellow and something was right behind it a shape pressing against the humped@ plastic standing there looking down at@ him half seen half imagined 
5178,his hand went@ out@ reached@ for the submachine gun his fingers tightening@ on the stock
5179,with@ a blood-curdling growl the curtain was snatched aside
5180,forster half@ rolled his uzi trembling@ in his hand as he got@ off@ half@ a clip at@ point blank range@ 
5181,but it struck speed attacking@ snake@ 
5182,and something else something he saw as the curtain tore away and he looked into@ the depths@ of the unbelievable face above him fractionally dulled his reflexes 
5183,friday # september to@ tuesday # september
5184,once free@ of the knotted@ tentacles@ of the eastern suburbs dalgliesh made@ good time and by@ three he was driving through lydsett village
5185,here a right turn took@ him off the coastal road on to what was little more than a smoothly macadamed track bordered by water-filled ditches and fringed by a golden@ haze@ of reeds their lumbered@ heads@ straining@ in the wind
5186,and now for the first time he thought that he could smell the north sea that potent but half-@ tang evoking nostalgic memories of childhood holidays of solitary adolescent walks as he struggled@ with@ his first poems of his aunt's tall figure at his side binoculars round her neck striding towards the haunts@ of her beloved birds
5187,and here barring@ the road was the familiar old farm gate still in place
5188,its continued presence always surprised@ him since it served@ no purpose that he could see@ except to cut@ off@ the headland@ and to give@ travellerspause to consider whether they really wanted to continue 
5189,it swung open at@ his touch but closing it as always was more difficult and he lugged and half lifted it into place and slipped the circle of wire over the gatepost with@ a familiar@ sensation of having turned@ his back@ on@ the workaday world@ and entered country which no matter how frequent his visits would always be alien@ territory@ 
5190,he was driving now across the open headland towards the fringe of pine trees which bordered the north sea
5191,the only house to his left was the old victorian rectory a square red-brick building incongruous behind its struggling@ hedge of rhododendron and laurel
5192,to his right the ground rose@ gently@ towards the southern cliffs and he could see the dark mouth@ of a concrete pillbox@ undemolished since the war and as seemingly indestructible as the great hulks of wave-battered@ concrete remnants of the old fortifications which lay@ half-submerged@ in the sand along part of the beach
5193,to the north the broken arches and stumps@ of the ruined benedictine abbey gleamed golden@ in the afternoon sun against@ the crinkled@ blue of the sea and breasting a small ridge he glimpsed for the first time the topsail of larksoken mill and beyond it against@ the skyline the great grey bulk of larksoken nuclear power station
5194,the road he was on veering@ left would lead@ eventually to the station but was he knew seldom used since normal traffic and all heavy vehicles used@ the new access road to the north
5195,the headland was empty and almost bare@ the few straggling@ trees distorted by the wind struggled@ to keep@ their precarious hold@ in the uncompromising@ soil
5196,and now he was passing a second and more dilapidated pillbox@ and it struck@ him that the whole headland had the desolate@ look of an old battlefield the corpses long since carted away but the air vibrating@ still with@ the gunfire of long-lost@ battles while the power station loomed over it a grandiose@ modern@ monument@ to@ the unknown@ dead@ 
5197,on@ his previous visits to larksoken he had seen martyr's cottage spread@ out@ beneath him when he and his aunt had stood surveying the headland from the small top room under the cone of the mill
5198,but he had never been closer to it than the road and now driving up@ it it struck@ him again that the description cottage was hardly appropriate
5199,it was a substantial two-storey l-shaped house standing@ to the east of the track with walls partly flint and partly rendered enclosing at the rear a courtyard of york stone which gave@ an uninterrupted view over fifty yards of scrub to the grassy dunes and the sea
5200,no one appeared as he drew up and before lifting his hand to the bell he paused to read the words of a stone plaque embedded in the flints to the right of the door
5201,in a cottage on this@ site lived agnes poley protestant martyr burned at ipswich #th august # aged # years
5202,ecclesiastes chapter # verse #
5203,the plaque was unadorned the letters deeply carved in@ an elegant script reminiscent of eric gill and dalgliesh remembered his aunt telling him that it had been placed there by previous owners in@ the late twenties when the cottage was originally extended
5204,one of the advantages of a religious education is the ability to identify at least the better-known texts of scripture and this@ was one which it needed no effort of memory to recall@ 
5205,as a delinquent nine-year-old at his prep school he had once been required by the headmaster to write out in@ his best handwriting the whole@ of the third chapter of ecclesiastes old gumboil economical in@ this@ as in@ all matters believing that writing lines@ should combine@ punishment with@ literary and religious education
5206,the words in@ that@ round childish script had remained@ with@ him
5207,it was he thought an interesting choice of text 
5208,that@ which hath been is now and that@ which is to be hath already been and god requireth that@ which is past
5209,he rang and there was only a short@ delay before alice mair opened the door
5210,he saw a tall handsome woman dressed with@ careful@ and expensive informality in a black cashmere sweater with a silk scarf at the throat and fawn trousers
5211,he would have recognized her from@ her strong@ resemblance to@ her brother although she looked the elder by@ some years
5212,she took@ it for granted that each knew who the other was and standing aside to motion him in she said it's good of you to be so accommodating mr dalgliesh
5213,i'm afraid nora gurney is implacable
5214,once she knew you were on your way to norfolk you were a predestined@ victim@ 
5215,perhaps you would bring the proofs through to the kitchen
5216,it was a distinguished face with the deep-set widely spaced eyes beneath straight brows a well-shaped rather secretive@ mouth and strong greying hair swept@ upwards and curled into@ a chignon
5217,in@ her publicity photographs she could he recalled@ look beautiful in@ a somewhat intimidating intellectual@ and very english mould@ 
5218,but seen face to face even in@ the informality of her own house the absence of a spark@ of sexuality and he sensed a deep-seated reserve made@ her seem less feminine and more formidable than he had expected and she held@ herself stiffly@ as if repelling@ invaders@ of her personal space@ 
5219,the handshake with which she had greeted him had been cool@ and firm and her brief@ smile was surprisingly attractive
5220,he knew that he was oversensitive to@ the timbre of the human voice and hers although not jarring@ or unpleasant sounded a little forced as if she were deliberately speaking at@ an unnatural pitch
5221,he followed her down@ the hall to the kitchen at the back@ of the house
5222,it was he judged almost twenty feet long and obviously served@ the triple purpose of sitting room working place and office
5223,the right-hand half of the room was a well-equipped kitchen with a large gas stove and an aga a butcher's chopping block a dresser to the right of the door holding@ an assortment of gleaming pots and a long working surface with a wooden triangle sheathing@ her assortment of knives
5224,in the centre of the room was a large wooden table holding@ a stoneware jar of dried flowers
5225,on the left-hand wall was a working@ fireplace the two recesses fitted@ with wall-to-ceiling bookshelves
5226,to each side of the hearth was a high-backed@ wicker armchair in@ an intricate closely woven design fitted@ with patchwork cushions
5227,there was an open roll-top desk facing one of the wide windows and to its right a stable door the top half open gave@ a view of the paved courtyard
5228,dalgliesh could glimpse what was obviously her herb garden planted in elegant terracotta pots carefully disposed to catch@ the sun
5229,the room which contained nothing superfluous nothing pretentious was both pleasing and extraordinarily comforting and for a moment he wondered why
5230,was it the faint@ smell of herbs and newly baked dough the soft@ ticking of the wall-mounted@ clock which seemed both to mark@ the passing@ seconds and yet to hold@ time in@ thrall the rhythmic moaning@ of the sea through the half-open door the sense of well-fed@ ease conveyed@ by the two cushioned armchairs the open hearth
5231,or was it that the kitchen reminded dalgliesh of that rectory kitchen where the lonely only child had found@ warmth@ and undemanding@ uncensorious@ companionship been given hot dripping toast and small forbidden treats
5232,he placed the proofs on the desk refused alice mair's offer of coffee and followed her back@ to the front door
5233,she walked out with him to the car and said i was sorry about@ your aunt sorry for you i mean
5234,i expect that for an ornithologist death ceases to be terrible once sight and hearing begin to go@ 
5235,and to die in@ one's sleep without@ distress to@ oneself or inconvenience to@ others is an enviable end@ 
5236,but you had known her for so long that she must have seemed immortal
5237,formal@ condolences he thought were never easy to speak or accept and usually sounded either banal or insincere
5238,hers had been perceptive
5239,jane dalgliesh had indeed seemed to@ him immortal
5240,the very old he thought make@ our past
5241,once they go it seems for a moment that neither it nor we have@ any real existence
5242,he said i don't think death was ever terrible to@ her
5243,i'm not sure that i really knew her and i'm left wishing i'd tried harder
5244,but i shall miss her
5245,alice mair said i didn't know her either
5246,perhaps i should have tried harder too
5247,she was a very private woman i suspect one of those fortunate people who find@ no other company more agreeable than their own
5248,it always seems presumptuous to encroach@ on@ that self-sufficiency
5249,perhaps you share@ it
5250,but if you can tolerate company i'm having@ a few people mostly colleagues of alex from@ the power station to@ dinner on@ thursday night
5251,would you care to join us
5252,seven thirty for eight
5253,it sounded he thought more like a challenge than an invitation
5254,somewhat to@ his surprise dalgliesh found@ himself accepting 
5255,but then the whole@ encounter had been a little surprising
5256,she stood regarding him with@ a serious@ intensity as he let in the clutch and turned the car and he had@ the impression@ that she was watching critically to see how he handled@ it
5257,but at least he thought as he gave@ a final wave she hadn't asked him whether he had come to norfolk to help catch the whistler 
5258,three minutes later he raised his foot from the accelerator
5259,ahead of him trudging along on the left of the path was a little group of children the eldest girl wheeling a pushchair with two smaller children one each side of her clutching the bars
5260,hearing the noise of the car she turned and he saw a peaked@ delicate face framed@ with red-gold@ hair
5261,he recognized the blaney children met once before with their mother walking along the beach
5262,obviously the eldest girl had been shopping the folding pushchair had a shelf under the seat lumped high with plastic bags
5263,instinctively he slowed down
5264,they were unlikely to be in@ real danger the whistler stalked at@ night not in@ broad@ daylight and no vehicle had passed him since he left the coastal road
5265,but the child looked grossly overburdened and ought not to be so far from home
5266,though he had never seen their cottage he seemed to remember that his aunt had told him that it lay@ about@ two miles to the south
5267,he recalled@ what he knew about@ them that their father earned a precarious@ living as a painter whose innocuous prettified watercolours were sold in cafs and tourist shops along the coast and that their mother had been desperately ill with@ cancer
5268,he wonderedwhether mrs blaney was still alive
5269,his instinct was to pile the children into the car and drive them home but that he knew was hardly sensible
5270,almost certainly the eldest child theresa wasn't it had been taught not to accept lifts from@ strangers particularly men and he was virtually a stranger
5271,on@ an impulse@ he reversed the jaguar and drove quickly back@ to martyr's cottage
5272,this@ time the front door was open and a swathe@ of sunlight lay@ across the red-tiled floor
5273,alice mair had heard the car and came out to him from the kitchen wiping her hands
5274,he said the blaney children are walking home
5275,theresa is wheeling a pushchair and trying to cope with@ the twins
5276,i thought i could offer a lift if i had a woman with me someone they know
5277,she said briefly they know me
5278,without@ another word she went back into the kitchen then came out to him closed the front door after her without@ locking it and got into the car
5279,putting it into gear his arm brushed@ her knee
5280,he was aware of an almost imperceptible withdrawing@ more emotional than physical a small@ delicate@ gesture of self-containment@ 
5281,dalgliesh doubted whether that half-@ recoil had@ anything to do with@ him personally nor did he find@ her silence disconcerting
5282,their conversation when they did speak was brief@ 
5283,he asked is mrs blaney still alive
5284,no
5285,she died six weeks ago
5286,how are they managing@ 
5287,not particularly well i imagine
5288,but ryan blaney doesn't welcome@ interference@ 
5289,i sympathize
5290,once he lets@ down@ his defences@ half@ the social workers in norfolk amateur and professional will move@ in@ on@ him
5291,when they drew up beside the little band it was alice mair who opened the car door and spoke
5292,theresa here is mr dalgliesh to give@ you all a lift
5293,he's miss dalgliesh's nephew from larksoken mill
5294,one of the twins had better sit on my lap
5295,the rest of you and the pushchair can fit into the back@ 
5296,theresa looked at@ dalgliesh without@ smiling and said a grave thank you
5297,she reminded him of pictures of the young elizabeth tudor the same red-gold@ hair framing@ a curiously adult face both secretive@ and self-composed the same sharp@ nose and wary@ eyes
5298,the faces of the twins softer@ editions@ of her own turned@ towards her questioningly then broke@ into@ shy@ smiles
5299,they looked as if they had been dressed in@ a hurry and not very suitably for a long@ walk on the headland even in@ a warm autumn
5300,one wore a tattered summer dress in@ pink spotted cotton with double flounces the other a pinafore over a checked blouse
5301,their pathetically thin legs were unprotected
5302,theresa was wearing jeans and a grubby sweat shirt with a map of london's underground across the front
5303,dalgliesh found@ himself wondering if it had been brought back from@ a school trip to the capital
5304,it was too large for her and the wide sleeves of limp cotton hung from her freckled arms rags@ thrown@ over@ a stick@ 
5305,in@ contrast@ to@ his sisters anthony was over@ a bundle of leggings jumperand a padded jacket topped with a woollen helmet with a bobble pulled well down over his forehead beneath which he surveyed their busyness unsmiling a stout@ imperious@ caesar@ 
5306,dalgliesh got out of the jaguar and tried to extricate him from the pushchair but the anatomy@ of the chair momentarily defeated@ him
5307,there was a bar beneath which the child's rigid legs were obstinately@ stuck
5308,the solid@ uncooperative@ bundle was surprisingly heavy it was trying@ to manoeuvre@ a firm@ and rather smelly@ poultice@ 
5309,theresa gave@ him a brief@ pitying smile dragged the plastic bags from beneath the seat then expertly freed her brother and settled him on her left hip while with the other hand she collapsed@ the pushchair with a single vigorous shake
5310,dalgliesh took the baby from her while theresa helped the children into the jaguar and commanded@ with@ sudden fierceness sit still
5311,anthony recognizing incompetence grasped dalgliesh's hair firmly with a sticky hand and he felt the momentary touch of a cheek so soft that it was the fall@ of a petal@ 
5312,throughout@ these manoeuvrings alice mair sat quietly watching from the car but made no move to help
5313,it was impossible to know what she was thinking
5314,but once the jaguar had moved away she turned to theresa and said in@ a voice of surprising gentleness does your father know that you're out alone
5315,daddy has taken the van to mr sparks
5316,it's due for its mot test
5317,mr sparks doesn't think it's going to pass@ 
5318,and i found@ we'd run@ out@ milk for anthony
5319,we have to have milk
5320,and we wanted some more disposable nappies
5321,alice mair said i'm giving@ a dinner party on@ thursday evening
5322,if your father agrees would you like to come and help with the table like you did last month
5323,what are you going to cook miss mair 
5324,put your head close so that i can whisper
5325,mr dalgliesh is going to be one of the guests
5326,i want it to be a surprise 
5327,the pale golden@ head leaned forward towards the grey and miss mair whispered
5328,theresa smiled and then nodded with@ serious satisfaction in@ a moment of grave feminine conspiracy
5329,but next@ morning ruth awakened early and leaving miss beard to@ her gentle@ dreams dressed quickly and hurried out of the house
5330,it was another golden@ day
5331,she still retained@ her english habit@ of noting@ each day's weather always expecting changes marvelling at@ the hot sunny days which followed@ one after@ the other almost with@ monotony
5332,when she reached the plateau she remained standing watching for joss barnet waiting for the moment when she would see him riding towards her
5333,there was no longer any need for her to be
5334,discovered@ 
5335,her sole purpose in@ being there was to meet him and she was content that he should know it
5336,he was late this@ morning
5337,or was she earlier than she thought
5338,had she misjudged@ the time
5339,no matter
5340,she was happy to wait for him certain that soon she would see him riding towards her
5341,then as the minutes passed@ and there was no sign@ of him she considered@ that perhaps he had overslept
5342,it could happen
5343,or had his horse gone lame cast a shoe
5344,she sat down and prepared to wait as long as was necessary
5345,she knew that in@ the end@ he would come
5346,after@ a few more minutes she became restless and stood up again her eyes searching@ the slope of the hillside and the valley below trying@ to determine whether some small@ movement down there was a man on horseback or merely a trick@ of her imagination
5347,should she set off down the hill to meet him
5348,but perhaps he would come by another route and then she would miss@ him
5349,at@ the end@ of what she reckoned@ must be an hour she faced@ the fact that he was not coming
5350,she dropped to the ground again and lay down burying@ her face in the sweet-@ grass
5351,she had been mistaken ever to think that he would come
5352,she had let@ her overwhelming desire feed@ her imagination had read@ something into@ his words his looks his actions which had not been there@ at all
5353,her face burned@ with@ the shame of it
5354,such was the feeling joss barnet had aroused@ in@ her that not for one moment did it occur to@ her to blame him for anything
5355,it was all her fault@ 
5356,sick at@ heart she wept
5357,then she dried her eyes on the hem of her petticoat and went slowly back@ to the house
5358,so you've decided to put@ in@ an appearance
5359,cook said
5360,i do seem to recall@ something about@ you offering to help me with@ the party preparations
5361,but of course if you've changed@ your mind
5362,i haven't ruth snapped@ 
5363,i'm ready to start now
5364,i don't want any breakfast
5365,hoity-toity
5366,what's the matter@ with@ everyone this@ morning
5367,cook demanded
5368,there's sean o'farrell and the master left in@ a hurry this@ hour past@ for new york city both without@ a bite inside them and now you
5369,gone to new york
5370,that@'s what i said
5371,with@ mrs cranbrook's words ruth's appetite immediately returned@ 
5372,so he had not failed her after@ all
5373,how could she have thought that he would
5374,something unforeseen and urgent had happened since sean had obviously known of it yesterday afternoon and there had been no opportunity for him to inform her
5375,relief surged@ through@ her a physical@ infusion@ of new@ blood@ 
5376,i've changed@ my mind she said
5377,i would like some breakfast
5378,suddenly i'm hungry
5379,when will they be back@ 
5380,sean
5381,how should i know
5382,i don't understand business
5383,what i understand is that if the master's not home for the party tomorrow the mistress won't be pleased and that@'s putting@ it mildly@ 
5384,don't you dawdle over@ your breakfast then not if you intend to make@ yourself useful@ 
5385,there's plenty to be done
5386,ruth worked all that@ day as though she had@ the strength of ten
5387,they prepared chicken pies the pastry light@ ruth@'s heart@ turtle soup a haunch of venison jellies blancmanges syllabubs trifles and a host@ of other dishes with@ still more to be done on@ the day of the party itself
5388,mrs cranbrook unbent so far@ as to show@ approval
5389,you've done very well she conceded@ 
5390,mrs carson knowing how much was involved had excused ruth from@ all other duties until@ anna's bedtime hour
5391,and now it approached@ 
5392,she took off the voluminous apron cook had lent her and went in search of her charge@ 
5393,anna was in@ tears
5394,we're going home she sobbed
5395,i don't want to go back to mrs gutermann's
5396,i want to stay with edward
5397,i want to live with him for ever and ever
5398,ruth could think of few worse fates but her stomach lurched@ at@ the thought of leaving millfield
5399,how do you know we're leaving she asked
5400,who told you
5401,miss fitch anna wailed
5402,i don't like miss fitch
5403,i hate her
5404,i daresay wants me to go
5405,perhaps she's mistaken ruth said though she doubted if miss fitch was ever wrong
5406,we'll ask your mama the moment she comes in
5407,i'm afraid it's true mrs carson told them
5408,of course we were only invited for ten days or so
5409,ruth had lost@ count of time
5410,to@ her the long@ summer days had stretched@ ahead@ world@ without@ end@ 
5411,we are going to leave on@ sunday mrs carson went@ on@ 
5412,not too early in@ the day since i daresay we shall all be tired after@ tomorrow's party
5413,anna tells me she never wants to leave edward ruth said after the child had gone@ to@ sleep
5414,mrs carson smiled indulgently
5415,dearest anna
5416,she's a little young for a holiday infatuation but we all have@ them sooner or later
5417,thank goodness they never last@ 
5418,and the more intense@ they are the shorter@ the duration so anna should soon be over@ it
5419,will mr barnet be back@ for the party
5420,ruth asked
5421,i expect you mean will o'farrell be back@ mrs carson said
5422,and the answer is i don't know
5423,mrs barnet tells me that she expects her husband when she sees him
5424,it's a fact that american men seem to put@ businessbefore@ everything
5425,thank goodness englishmen are not like that@ 
5426,next@ morning ruth was down@ in the kitchen early eagerly hoping to find sean there
5427,he could well have returned late at@ night and she not heard him though she had stayed awake for a long@ time listening for the sound of the horses the carriage wheels on the drive
5428,there was no sign@ of sean but mrs cranbrook was already at@ work
5429,i hope you're ready to help me she said
5430,everybody is busy with@ this@ and that@ as if food wasn't the most important thing@ 
5431,i'll help mrs cranbrook ruth agreed
5432,they're not back@ then
5433,she tried to sound nonchalant
5434,not back@ 
5435,oh you mean o'farrell and the master
5436,not that i know of
5437,there's no telling when return
5438,sometimes they're gone for three or four days at@ a time
5439,but surely with@ the party
5440,mrs cranbrook shrugged
5441,he's a law@ unto@ himself the master
5442,not for the likes of you and me to question why
5443,the heart@ had gone out of the day
5444,ruth fetched and carried and stirred and whipped praying every moment that joss barnet would return before they left millfield next@ day
5445,but when the day had dragged@ to@ evening in spite of all there was to do the time now passed@ slowly@ and still there was no sign@ of the two men she began to lose@ hope
5446,in@ the evening bone-tired she left the kitchen and went to put a reluctant anna to bed
5447,then she turned@ to@ helping mrs carson
5448,she brushed her mistress's hair and piled it on top of her head in@ a cluster@ of curls carefully and meticulously arranged to look quite casual
5449,it was a style ruth had devised herself and mrs carson was delighted with@ the result
5450,it looks so different she said
5451,you really are quite clever at@ this@ ruth
5452,and now for my dress
5453,she looked beautiful in the yellow satin the low-cut bodice tight against her slight figure the skirt billowing out
5454,but ruth had@ no heart@ either to appreciate or to envy her mistress
5455,her spirits@ were at@ their lowest@ ebb@ 
5456,mrs carson gave@ her maid a sharp@ compassionate@ look
5457,she thought she knew the cause of this@ mood and in@ a way@ she was glad to see it
5458,at least it showed@ that the girl's mind was working@ in@ the right direction@ 
5459,don't worry ruth she said kindly
5460,i dare say o'farrell will be back@ tomorrow before we leave
5461,and if not there is always new york when the barnets return in@ the fall@ 
5462,and now i shan't need you again this@ evening so apart from looking in on@ anna from time to time you may do just as you please
5463,had she not been so downhearted ruth would have enjoyed herself
5464,but she had given up all hope of joss barnet returning that@ evening and nothing else in@ the world mattered
5465,the party scene@ was pretty enough
5466,coloured lanterns hung in the trees which fringed the lawn and bordered the lake beyond
5467,torchlights flaring@ against@ the night sky and reflected in the water had been set up wherever it was suitable
5468,already the orchestra had begun to play and the elegantly dressed to appear
5469,ruth had@ no heart@ for it
5470,she climbed the stairs to her room then undressed and went to bed wetting the pillow with her tears which held back all day now flowed unchecked
5471,her only comfort was not to have miss beard in her room to be able to suffer in@ solitude
5472,though she thought sleep would never come@ eventually it did@ 
5473,she fell@ asleep to@ the sound of music drifting@ upwards from the drawing-room
5474,when she wakened it was still dark the orchestra still playing though it was not that@ which had aroused her
5475,penetrating@ her sleep she had heard the faint@ click of the door latch and then the familiar squeak of the hinge as the door to her room slowly opened
5476,she raised herself on one elbow blinking her eyes trying to see in@ the darkness
5477,but enough light came@ from the landing on to which the door opened to silhouette the man standing there
5478,it was joss barnet
5479,shock@ made@ her cry out and he closed the door and moved towards her in@ quick strides putting his hand across her mouth to stop-her scream
5480,then he sat on her bed and without@ a word from@ either of them she went willingly into his arms and was held close in@ his embrace
5481,she felt his heart beating@ strong@ and fast against hers
5482,they stayed like that@ for a long@ moment and then he said light the candle
5483,i can't she whispered
5484,someone will see the light under the door
5485,no matter if they do he said
5486,they will not think of me here
5487,only my coachman knows i am home
5488,i have not yet joined@ the party
5489,you came to me first
5490,she could hardly believe it
5491,he would not tell her this@ funny bewitching@ little english girl that he had come to her first because he could not keep away from her
5492,she had been on@ his mind since the morning he had seen her from his horse frightened yet defiant sparking@ with@ anger
5493,almost but not quite she had come between@ him and the work he had had to do in new york city
5494,the moment the work was done he had ordered@ his coachman to drive him back@ to millfield as fast as the horses would go
5495,light the candle he repeated
5496,ruth's fingers trembled@ as she obeyed him
5497,then she lay back on her pillow and they looked at each other as if it was for the first time
5498,he tracedthe contours of her face with gentle@ fingers outlining the curve of her mouth stroking her temples
5499,without@ any hurry in spite of the impatience which had brought@ him here he caressed the length of her neck and the slope@ of her shoulders
5500,from@ out of@ nowhere ruth remembered dick parker but not this@ time the pleasure of her union@ with@ him only the pain@ it had brought@ her on@ the christmas eve following@ 
5501,and now although her whole body cried@ out@ for fulfilment and she longed for joss barnet to complete what he had surely come to do she knew that she must not let it happen
5502,she turned her face away from him pushed his hand from her
5503,no she cried
5504,you must not 
5505,he gave@ not the slightest@ sign@ of having heard her continuing to stroke her neck and now inserting his fingers under the neckline of her nightshift
5506,she tried again to push him away
5507,please
5508,please don't she cried
5509,it was surprise which made@ him stop for a second
5510,he smiled at@ her an unexpectedly tender@ smile
5511,i won't hurt you he said
5512,don't be afraid
5513,i'm not afraid of being hurt
5514,then what
5515,i'm afraid of afterwards she said hesitantly
5516,if i were to have@ a child
5517,it would be the end@ of the world@ for me
5518,but you won't he assured her
5519,i'll see@ to@ that@ 
5520,i'm not totally callous
5521,you promise
5522,i promise
5523,she lay quiescent and felt his strong fingers quicker now move@ to unfasten the buttons of her shift one by one
5524,and when he had undone her gown and had@ difficulty in@ lifting it over her head she raised herself from the pillow and helped him to take it off
5525,then he pulled down the sheet which was all the bedclothes she had needed on@ that warm night and she lay naked before him
5526,she observed him without@ shame as he looked at every part of her
5527,her pleasure was in@ him and in@ his delight of her
5528,when at last he stripped@ off@ his clothes and came into her it was as if this@ was the moment to@ which all her life had been leading@ 
5529,he was a skilful lover tender and gentle in@ the beginning then powerful persistent rough@ almost until his passion rising@ in@ harmony@ with@ hers the climax@ came@ the bursting@ of a thousand@ stars@ the beginning@ and ending@ of the world@ 
5530,afterwards they lay quietly side by side not speaking until he said i must go
5531,not yet she begged
5532,you can't leave me yet
5533,she turned over and lay on top of him trying to pin him down with@ her own slight weight and he began to fondle her and she him and almost at once they were making@ love again
5534,you are a sorceress@ he told her when it was all over@ 
5535,an enchantress@ 
5536,women as tempting as you should be kept out of@ the sight of mortal men
5537,you're not a mortal man ruth said
5538,you're a god@ 
5539,he laughed out loud
5540,hush she cautioned
5541,someone will hear you
5542,i'm a real man all right he said
5543,as i've just proved to@ you
5544,and would again if time allowed@ 
5545,then he stood up and quickly began to dress
5546,i must go and do my duty as a host for what's left@ of the night
5547,don't leave me she begged
5548,please stay
5549,he looked at@ her in@ surprise spoke brusquely
5550,but of course i must go
5551,there's no question
5552,long@ afterwards ruth realised that this@ was the moment when she had learned that she could never come@ first with@ him
5553,however much he might desire her she would have@ no more than the allotted space@ in@ his life
5554,when am i going to see you again she asked
5555,that also was the wrong thing@ to say
5556,i can't make@ plans@ he said sharply
5557,but we leave tomorrow she exclaimed
5558,that@ took@ him by surprise
5559,the deuce@ you do
5560,well i shall see@ to@ that@ 
5561,my wife will extend@ the invitation to@ the carsons
5562,i take@ it they're not promised elsewhere
5563,oh no ruth said
5564,we're going back to new york city
5565,he finished dressing then came and held her by the shoulders kissing her lightly on the mouth
5566,as he was leaving he turned around and threw a small box on to the bed
5567,from the city he said
5568,you see that i had@ you in@ my mind
5569,he was out of the room before she could open the box a dark@ blue leather affair@ lined with@ white velvet against which lay a fine gold chain with a small oval locket set around the edge with seed pearls
5570,she gasped in@ amazement
5571,it was without@ doubt the most beautiful thing she had ever owned or ever would
5572,such delicacy such refinement@ 
5573,her fingers trembling@ with@ excitement she fastened it around her neck
5574,it should remain there for ever
5575,she would never take it off
5576,ellen and i lingered on in mama sipcott's for another hour and a half@ indulging in@ the sailor's shorebound pastime of planning@ the perfect voyage
5577,we decided that would sail from the bahamas to panama and thence to the galapagos where we would find darwin's giant tortoises
5578,then we would sail south to easter island to explore the mysterious statues before@ going to the mutineers' refuge on pitcairn island
5579,after@ that@ we would go to tahiti and i saw the excitement grow@ in@ ellen as she realised that these@ plans@ were so close@ to@ coming@ true 
5580,it was an excitement that matched@ my own for i had never sailed the south seas and i had long dreamed@ of that@ scatter@ of tiny magically@ named islands strewn@ across one third of a globe
5581,by@ the time we had drunk our third bottle of wine ellen and i had long reached@ new zealand and were already sailing north towards new caledonia
5582,we were happy
5583,we caught@ the bus back@ to ellen's apartment and collected her clothes and notebooks
5584,she was moving back@ on board in@ preparation for the next@ day's early departure
5585,i carried her luggage to the yard noting@ that even ellen's strident@ feminism evaporated@ in@ the face@ of two heavy bags and tropical heat
5586,once in the boatyard ellen ran ahead of me evidently eager to reach's air conditioning
5587,then as she reached the dock's edge she suddenly checked
5588,what on earth is that
5589,oh no
5590,she began to run again
5591,when i reached the water's edge i understood her dismay
5592,a large sports-fishing boat was moored alongside but moored so crudely@ that whoever had brought the powerboat alongside the schooner had not bothered to put out fenders but instead had gouged long ugly gashes in's white paint
5593,yet even the gashes were not so ugly as the expensive boat that had caused them
5594,there was nothing wrong with@ the boat's lines which were sleekly@ functional but her@ long powerful@ hull her@ upperworks and even the interior of her@ capacious working deck had all been painted with a wartime dazzle paint
5595,the seemingly random and jagged-edged pattern of blue black silver green and white had been designed to disguise@ a boat's shape from@ the prying@ eyes of u-boat captains so it seemed somewhat fanciful to thus camouflage a pleasure boat in the bahamas
5596,this@ boat was called@ and she@ was clearly an expensive infant@ for rods and whip-@ and outriggers splayed@ from her@ upperworks the antennae@ of some outlandish@ insect@ 
5597,she@ boasted@ a harpoon walkway a fly@ and above the highest wheel-platform an aluminium canopy@ which held@ a radar aerial
5598,the fighting chair on her@ aft deck had@ thick white leather straps giving@ it the of a padded@ electric@ chair@ while the dazzle paint gave@ the boat an oddly military look that was completed by the number # that was painted on her@ bows@ in silver-edged black numerals like those@ warships use@ to display their commissioning numbers
5599,the boat's wrap-around@ windscreens were made of black polarised glass which only added@ to@'s ugly@ air@ of menace
5600,ellen unencumbered with@ luggage had already reached and taken two plastic fenders from a locker
5601,she swung lithely down to's gaudily painted deck and cushioned the two hulls
5602,how bad is the damage
5603,i called down to@ her when i reached 
5604,it's scraped back@ to bare@ metal
5605,i'll give@ it some paint
5606,'s hull was made of steel and while such hulls are marvellously strong@ and safe they are soon weakened@ if their steel is exposed to salt air
5607,i had to paint the gashes as soon as possible so that rust would not begin to bite@ into@'s long sleekness@ 
5608,ellen looked around the oddly painted powerboat
5609,you'd think someone rich enough to own a rig like this could afford a pair of fenders
5610,who cares
5611,just cut the damn boat loose i said vengefully
5612,ellen ignored my advice while i obedient to@ the rule@ that if a job needed doing then do it without@ delay found a pot of white paint and dug@ through the locker for a clean brush
5613,then from behind me an unfamiliar voice sounded oh ring@ my bells@ 
5614,it was a man's voice drawling and lazy@ 
5615,i twisted around and almost blinded myself by staring straight into the sun but then through@ the dizzying glare i made out the long silhouette of a tall man who seemed incongruously to be dressed in a long transparent dressing gown
5616,he was emerging in@ stately fashion from's companion@ and though i could see he was tall and lanky and had a ponytail of hair i could make out no details of his face
5617,who the hell@ are you
5618,i demanded
5619,the man ignored me walking instead towards ellen who dressed only in shorts and t-shirt was climbing long-legged over's rail
5620,be still@ my restless@ heart the man had a strong@ caressing@ voice and the slow@ luscious@ accent of america's deep@ south
5621,dear lady dear lady to think that i might have lived my whole@ life through@ and never seen you
5622,oh lay me down just lay me down
5623,ellen usually so quick with@ a scornful reply just stood and stared at the elegant stranger who stopped one pace away from her took her hand then bowed above her fingers
5624,he kissed the air a fastidiously polite inch above her knuckles then closed his eyes
5625,dear sweet lord@ above i do thank thee for thy kindness in@ showing me this lovely woman before i died
5626,to@ my astonishment and chagrin ellen left her hand in his as he opened his eyes and smiled at@ her
5627,my name he stroked@ her with@ his voice is jesse isambard sweetman
5628,and who dear creature are you
5629,ellen still said nothing
5630,i had straightened up and moved aside so that the sun no longer dazzled me and i could see sweetman properly and what i saw i did not like
5631,his face was old@ and young@ sardonic and knowing amused@ and handsome the face of a man who has seen the world's wickedness@ and knows how to match@ it with@ his own
5632,his long black hair was tied into its ponytail with a velvet ribbon his skin was parchment@ pale and his eyes dark@ 
5633,i put@ his age at@ forty but even among men twenty years younger he would have been accounted handsome and he knew it for his expression showed@ both confidence and amusement as he continued to hold ellen's hand and he showed@ even more amusement when she suddenly realised just what liberty@ she was thus granting him and jerked her fingers swiftly away
5634,thus released jesse sweetman turned to look at me
5635,the dressing gown had proved to be a long stylish ankle-length duster coat which was loosely woven from a delicate white cotton
5636,beneath the filmy topcoat he wore a black shirt and black trousers that were tucked into tall black boots
5637,it was a dramatic@ and impractical outfit of a kind i only expected to see on the male models@ who posed in@ the more outlandish fashion magazines that our rich clients brought aboard yet jesse isambard sweetman managed to wear the elaborate style with@ an elegant@ insouciance
5638,the only incongruous note@ was a cheap round badge enamelled in@ red and yellow that he wore on his shirt which bore@ the legend just say no
5639,you must be nicholas breakspear he said carelessly as though he did not much care whether i was or not
5640,is that gaudy piece of junk your boat
5641,i gestured to where's aerials showed above's gunwale
5642,sweetman turned and pretended to notice the sports-fishing boat for the first time
5643,no he said helpfully then bestowed@ a patronising smile on@ me
5644,you look so like your father
5645,it's really uncanny
5646,did you bring that boat here
5647,i persevered
5648,oh indeed i did he said brightly@ as though he merely indulged a rather dim@ child's curiosity
5649,your mother was malise fielding am i right
5650,or are you lucy de sills son
5651,why the hell@ didn't you use fenders when you tied alongside
5652,he sighed intimating what a bore i was being
5653,i did not use fenders breakspear because i despise precautions
5654,precautions are the symptoms@ of small@ and fearful@ minds
5655,precautions will not conquer@ empires they will not build@ great cities they will not transmute@ dreams into@ gold or carry@ men across wide oceans and precautions will not emphatically not win@ fair ladies and here he turned to ellen and lasciviously dropped@ his gaze to her long bare legs
5656,ellen twisted away and sweetman laughed at@ her obvious discomfiture then as coolly as though he owned he stepped down into the central cockpit where he first brushed@ at then sat on one of the white cushioned seats by the ship's wheel
5657,i've had@ a look round the boat he said very coolly and i approve of her@ 
5658,so tell me the cost of a week's charter
5659,the man you want to see i said is called matthew mcillvanney and his office is the pink building with the outside staircase
5660,he's not here this@ afternoon but you can doubtless telephone him next@ week
5661,sweetman took a pair of polarised sunglasses from his shirt pocket and put them on before@ inspecting me again
5662,he did not seem to like what he saw
5663,you're really not being noticeably helpful he said after@ a pause so let us try again shall we
5664,would you please tell me the high@ season price for one week
5665,how many passengers
5666,ellen asked before i could refuse to answer
5667,sweetman paused again this@ time to light a long pale@ blue cigarette with a slim@ gold lighter
5668,he shrugged
5669,two four six passengers
5670,does it really matter
5671,one week in@ high@ season costs ten thousand us dollars for two people and every extra couple is another thousand bucks
5672,ellen's voice was cold@ as though she disliked satisfying his curiosity
5673,and to@ those@ prices you have to add@ the boat's running costs
5674,which are
5675,sweetman asked carelessly
5676,a lot@ 
5677,ellen said flatly
5678,you're talking fuel food and liquor plus any toys you might want aboard like scuba equipment snorkels jet-skis or sailboards
5679,sweetman drew@ on his fancy cigarette then blew a plume@ of smoke into's rigging before smiling lazily at@ ellen
5680,and tell me sweet@ creature do you count@ as a toy@ 
5681,or are you a part@ of the initial ten thousand dollars 
5682,get off the boat i said
5683,shut up
5684,he turned@ on@ me a snake@ 
5685,you're nothing but a hired hand breakspear so shut the fuck up
5686,he glanced at the paint pot and brush that i was still holding
5687,go and paint something
5688,be useful
5689,he stared into@ my eyes challenging me to defy him and when i did not move he looked back@ to ellen
5690,i asked you a question dear heart@ 
5691,please be so good as to answer
5692,get off this boat i told him but my anger only amused sweetman who unfolded his long thin legs from the cushioned thwart
5693,dick off he said to@ me
5694,i was surprised that he so eagerly sought to confront@ me
5695,i am not a small man nor am i a weakling yet the thin sweetman seemed unconcerned as i jumped down into the cockpit@ 
5696,then i saw why he was so confident
5697,he put a hand into a pocket of his elegant duster coat and brought out a small # pistol that he pointed at my face
5698,a ladies gun he said but remarkably effective at close range
5699,nick
5700,ellen called warningly as though i might not have seen the gun
5701,the gun's threat@ had not stopped my advance
5702,i was calling@ sweetman's bluff confident he would not dare pull the trigger and equally confident that my marine training would let me turn@ him into@ mincemeat@ 
5703,i was also half drunk and thus filled@ with@ the dutch courage offered@ by mama sipcott's worst white wine
5704,sweetman stood
5705,there was at last a look of alarm on his face and i could see him wondering whether he really would have to pull the small trigger
5706,he held the gun pointed at my eyes
5707,we beat@ southwards all that@ first day slicing@ through a glittering sea and propelled by an apparently changeless south-easterly trade wind
5708,we hardly saw the crowninshield twins
5709,they briefly appeared on deck for lunch a meal which rickie hardly touched while robin-anne despite her apparent frailty attacked@ the sandwiches and salad savagery@ starving@ bear@ 
5710,afterwards incongruously dressed in a raincoat she went to the bows@ and stared briefly down at the mesmerising onrush of sea where it split@ and foamed at's cutwater
5711,she did not stay there long but retreated@ from the fierce@ sun to the stern-cabin that she would be sharing with ellen
5712,the contrast between@ the two american girls was almost painful@ ellen was so healthy and strong while the waif-like robin-anne was pathetically wan and listless
5713,what do you think of her
5714,i asked ellen that@ afternoon
5715,ellen gave@ me an amused@ glance
5716,little@ orphan annie
5717,it's hard@ to believe she's about@ to be worth@ six million dollars
5718,still she's got precious little else going@ for her
5719,i smiled at@ the severity of ellen's judgment
5720,is she that@ bad
5721,she has a distressingly simple mind with@ only room@ for a single idea at@ any one time
5722,presently that@ idea is cocaine and nothing but cocaine
5723,she has@ an obsession with@ the drug that verges@ on@ monomania
5724,she tells me she needs to understand it if she's going to defeat@ it
5725,don't you approve of that@ 
5726,i think she'd do better to understand herself ellen said tartly@ 
5727,she allowed a man to persuade her into@ taking the drug so she can only blame herself for her predicament
5728,she'd find@ it more useful to understand her own character shortcomings than to take@ an elementary course@ in@ drug chemistry
5729,what do you make@ of rickie
5730,i asked
5731,he's precisely what anyone would expect of a drop-out phys ed basketball-playing retard ellen said scornfully by which i mean that he's a jock brains dung@ beetle@ 
5732,he reminds me of your neanderthal@ friend the maggot@ except rickie is a great deal more handsome
5733,is he
5734,she laughed at@ the suspicion of jealousy in@ my voice
5735,yes nicholas he is
5736,but he's not cute
5737,at@ supper as at@ lunch robin-anne ate appetite horse@ though her brother hardly touched his chicken and pasta salad
5738,don't you like pasta
5739,ellen who was perversely proud of her skills in@ the salad department@ asked rickie with@ just a touch@ of asperity
5740,it's great@ 
5741,really awesome
5742,rickie lit a cigarette
5743,i just guess i'm not hungry
5744,robin-anne reached over and tipped her brother's food on to her own plate
5745,kind of starving@ she justified her theft@ then poured herself some diet soda
5746,for once we were carrying neither wine nor spirits@ on for jackson chatterton's drug clinic had utterly forbidden@ us to offer the twins any alcohol saying that any mood-altering drug could hamper@ the success@ of a detoxification programme
5747,we were thus officially a dry@ boat though i had hidden some irish whiskey in the engine room and i was sure that ellen would have similarly salted away some vodka
5748,it seemed that ellen and i were not the only ones to take@ such a precaution for late that@ night jackson chatterton lumbered on deck with a bottle in one huge hand
5749,bourbon he explained laconically
5750,want some
5751,i thought you'd never ask
5752,he chuckled produced@ two cardboard cups and poured me a generous@ slug@ of the whiskey
5753,we were alone on deck though not the only ones awake for i could hear rickie and ellen's voices coming@ from the open skylight of the main saloon
5754,i hoped thessy was fast asleep for he would be taking@ the morning watch
5755,cheers i said
5756,chatterton raised his cardboard cup in@ silent acknowledgement then stared ahead to where a great beam@ swept@ around the sky
5757,a lighthouse he asked in@ a voice which suggested@ that a prudent man avoided such things 
5758,i nodded
5759,it's called the hole in the wall
5760,once we're past it we can turn out to the open ocean
5761,things@ will be a bit livelier then
5762,livelier
5763,we'll have a bit more sea kick up some spray
5764,i had spoken enthusiastically but jackson chatterton seemed unmoved by the prospect@ 
5765,what are your plans@ he asked me
5766,i had@ nothing particular planned@ merely an idea that it might be interesting to thrash@ our way out into the open@ ocean though mindful of the danger of tropical storms i had@ no intention of going too far from the safe shelter of a bahamian hurricane hole
5767,but i fancied feeling the long@ hard@ pressure of ocean waves against our hull and though we were short-handed i reckoned@ that a few days out@ sight of land would shake@ us all down@ quickly
5768,i explained all that@ to@ chatterton but stressed@ that we would run@ for cover@ at@ the first sign@ of trouble
5769,he must have assumed@ that i meant trouble from@ the twins for he suddenly became surprisingly loquacious
5770,they won't give@ you any grief@ in@ the next@ few days he said
5771,now that they can't get@ hold@ of cocaine they'll just crash out
5772,i grimaced
5773,does that@ mean@ they'll be seeing green monkeys and blue snakes up the rigging
5774,chatterton poured himself more bourbon then put the bottle within my reach on the binnacle shelf
5775,coming@ off@ cocaine isn't like that@ 
5776,at first they'll just want to do nothing but eat and sleep
5777,it's the opposite of a cocaine high@ you see@ 
5778,he paused
5779,the difficult bit@ starts two or three days later
5780,that@'s when the real hell@ begins
5781,for all of us
5782,it won't be easy he said grimly and i was suddenly rather glad to have the taciturn chatterton aboard
5783,the big man had obviously come on deck to warn me what to expect from@ the twins and for that@ i was grateful
5784,i noticed that rickie wasn't eating today i said but robin-anne was 
5785,chatterton nodded
5786,rickie may have stopped his cocaine a day or two ago which means@ he's probably already over@ the crash@ period
5787,i promise you one thing@ he's brought none of it on board
5788,i searched him and his luggage and he was clean@ 
5789,the big man thought for a few seconds then laughed
5790,he'd better be clean@ 
5791,that@ turkey@ has got@ one chance of avoiding jail just one and that@ chance is by proving to@ the judge that he's cleaned@ up@ his act@ 
5792,and if he doesn't do that@ then the man will send rickie's plump young ass down@ to the gang-rape squad@ in the county jail
5793,chatterton did not sound unduly worried at@ that@ prospect@ 
5794,can we be sure robin-anne didn't bring any of the drug aboard
5795,i asked
5796,she won't have done that@ chatterton said with@ conviction@ 
5797,that@ girl is serious about@ giving it up real serious heavy@ serious
5798,that@ girl is really trying
5799,she studiesthe drug you know
5800,it was her enemy@ 
5801,chatterton had spoken with@ genuine admiration
5802,i glanced up at the sails down at the compass then ahead to where the lighthouse loom@ arced powerfully through@ the night
5803,so what are the twins chances
5804,depends on@ their will power 'cause nothing else will do@ it for them
5805,there ain't no pill to get@ you off@ the powder mr breakspear only will power 
5806,and let me tell you coming@ off@ coke is the hardest@ damn thing@ in the world and you're real lucky if you have a rich daddy who pays for people to hold@ your hand@ while you go@ through@ the hell@ of it
5807,the twins daddy has paid for you and me mr breakspear and for everyone else on board thisboat but even with@ all that@ money and all this boat we still might not succeed with@ them
5808,it's that@ hard@ 
5809,it is that@ hard@ he said ominously and i thought of john maggovertski's sadness for a pretty girl who had whored herself to pay for the white powder
5810,and it's even harder@ jackson chatterton's voice was suddenly sinister for a poor person who has@ no one to help them
5811,i stared at jackson chatterton and at last sensed the drama@ that lay@ behind@ his big@ calm@ presence
5812,why did you leave the army mr chatterton
5813,i asked after@ a long@ pause
5814,i guess you can guess he said
5815,i guessed but did not make@ him confirmmy guess
5816,instead i
5817,asked whether the american army had helped@ him to kick@ his drug habit@ 
5818,sure they tried they tried real hard@ but back@ then i didn't
5819,want to be helped
5820,but you still got@ off@ cocaine
5821,on@ your own
5822,eventually
5823,the light inside the binnacle glossed@ his black
5824,face with@ a sheen of red sparking@ his eyes like fire
5825,he was not looking at me but staring doggedly ahead into@ the turning@ white light of the hole in the wall
5826,and i had to lose@ a good good woman before i came@ to@ my senses
5827,but i did kick@ the drug mr breakspear and it was probably the hardest@ damned thing@ i ever did in@ all my life
5828,but once i'd done it i swore i'd help others do it
5829,even the very rich
5830,i asked provocatively
5831,the rich trash@ pay the bills mr breakspear which lets@ me give@ my spare@ time away@ to@ the poor trash@ 
5832,i looked at the tough@ impressive face
5833,are the twins trash@ 
5834,he paused before@ replying then gave@ the smallest shake of his head
5835,she's ok but him
5836,this@ time the pause was almost eloquent then he gave@ a richly@ contagious@ laugh
5837,i'd have liked to have had@ rickie crowninshield in my platoon for just five minutes
5838,i laughed too
5839,good to have@ you aboard
5840,it ain't bad being aboard he said and held out his hand and not before@ time we shook
5841,by@ midnight i was alone on deck and happy to be alone
5842,i like sailing alone at@ night
5843,i like to watch the phosphorescence curling@ away from the hull and i like to watch the brilliant specks@ of light fade@ in the black deep water far in the ship's wake
5844,i like to be alone under the careless@ profusion of the stars and alone on a moon-glossed sea
5845,i like the sounds of a boat sailing at@ night
5846,the sounds are the same as those@ of daylight yet somehow the night magnifies@ and sharpens@ the creak of a yielding@ block the sigh@ of air over a shroud the stretching of a sail the hiss@ of water sliding@ sleek@ against the hull the curl@ of a quarter-wave falling away and the thump as a wave strikes the cutwater to be sheared@ into@ two bright slices@ of whiteness
5847,i like the purposefulness of a boat at@ night as it slits@ a path@ across an empty planet
5848,i like the secretiveness@ of a boat in the blackness when the only thing to dislike is the prospect@ of dawn which seems a betrayal@ because at@ night in a boat under sail it is easy to feel@ very close@ to@ god for eternity is all around@ 
5849,i tacked the ship shortly after@ midnight doing the job by myself and enjoying the work
5850,ellen was still awake talking in the stateroom with rickie but everyone else seemed asleep
5851,i wished that ellen and rickie would go to their beds for the soft@ mutter of their voices was an intrusion@ on@ the dark and star-studded@ infinity through which i steered 
5852,the picture very like the one rufus fletcher had taken@ in@ the summer of # occupied@ the screen for about@ fifteen seconds
5853,the whole@ item was allowed@ no more than four times that@ in@ the bbc's sunday evening news broadcast at@ #
5854,the other forty-five seconds were taken up by a policeman talking to@ a reporter about@ having@ nothing to say except that there would be an inquest
5855,but shiva and lili manjusri saw the picture and so did rufus fletcher
5856,adam verne-smith unwinding@ in puerto de la cruz did not of course see it
5857,he did not even see an english newspaper
5858,they were expensive to buy and came@ a day late
5859,he did not want to be reminded of home and the only paper he even glanced at was the a copy of which anne found on the beach
5860,his father at home in edgware said to@ his wife
5861,good god wyvis hall as i live and breathe
5862,beryl verne-smith peered but the picture immediately vanished
5863,yes i suppose it was
5864,the policeman talked the reporter trying to jog@ him into@ revelations and failing
5865,in the background autumnal trees could be seen and a church on the summit of a low hill
5866,lewis verne-smith sat shaking his head less as a gesture of denial than of a generalized despair at@ the state of the world
5867,it was not that unpleasant memories were evoked for these@ were always with@ him his existence was inseparable from@ that@ old bitterness@ but that a sight of the house even the glimpse of a photograph revived@ the precise feelings he had had@ why it must be getting on for eleven years ago
5868,ten and a half said his wife
5869,i shall have to get in touch with the police
5870,no two ways@ about@ it i shall have to get in touch with them
5871,not this@ evening surely said beryl who wanted to watch mastermind
5872,lewis said nothing
5873,the room in which they were sitting underwent@ the curious@ shrinking@ process to@ which it was subject@ whenever he was reminded of wyvis hall or his uncle hilbert or even if the county of suffolk were mentioned
5874,suddenly it grew small and poky
5875,the brick side-wall of his neighbour's house to have moved@ itself four or five feet further towards the dividing fence so that it loomed offensively
5876,lewis got up and pulled the curtains across with@ a pettish@ jerk of his hands
5877,shouldn't you wait until adam gets back 
5878,beryl said
5879,why
5880,what would that@ be in aid of
5881,beryl meant that adam had been among@ the previous owners of wyvis hall while her husband had not but she knew better than to point@ this@ out@ 
5882,there is no one living knows that@ lovely place better than #
5883,that@'s true@ 
5884,i shan't wait till adam returns lewis said in@ that@ manner that had once led@ his daughter to call him the frog@ footman@ 
5885,but i shall wait until@ tomorrow
5886,men and women do not usually put@ their baser feelings@ and intentions into@ words not even in@ the deep@ recesses@ of their own minds
5887,so lewis did not say even to@ himself when he was privately@ considering@ trying to get@ hold@ of his son in tenerife that he disliked adam and would have been pleased to spoil his holiday
5888,instead he rationalized his thoughts and justified@ himself adam probably indeed almost certainly knew nothing about@ the find in the pine wood but adam had once owned the house and had thus taken on a responsibility
5889,he could not shed@ that@ responsibility just because he had sold the place
5890,lewis would have agreed with@ oscar wilde that our past is what we are
5891,we cannot rid ourselves of it
5892,therefore it was adam's duty to come home and face@ the music@ even though this@ might be no more than a short@ blast@ on@ a tin@ whistle@ 
5893,but he had@ no precise idea where adam was and he did not think adam's travel agent a personal friend of the young verne-smiths would tell him
5894,some excuse would be made@ for not telling him
5895,lewis's bark@ anyway was always worse than his bite@ 
5896,he had@ virtually no bite@ as he had once overheard adam say to@ bridget and heard it with@ helpless@ chagrin
5897,a bloody@ good thing@ or our childhood would have been a misery instead of just a bore
5898,lewis walked into his local police station in edgware on@ monday morning
5899,they seemed surprised to see him but not astonished
5900,the suffolk police had begun hunting@ up@ previous owners of wyvis hall and they had been alerted that a verne-smith lived in their area
5901,there were after@ all only two in@ the london phone directory
5902,this@ might be a bonus 
5903,he was asked to wait and then shown into a room where a detective sergeant prepared@ to take@ a statement from@ him
5904,with@ busy@ pomposity lewis dictated it to@ a typist and would have gone@ on@ and on@ had he not been diplomatically restrained@ 
5905,wyvis hall nunes suffolk and the twenty acres of land surrounding it were the property through@ his marriage of my uncle hilbert verne-smith
5906,they came@ into@ the possession of my son hilbert john adam verne-smith under@ my uncle's will bypassing@ myself though my son was no more than nineteen at@ the time of my uncle's death
5907,being an undergraduate at@ the time my son naturally never considered@ actually residing in the house
5908,he was in@ agreement with@ my suggestion that the property be sold and before he returned to college in@ the autumn of # he took@ my advice and placed@ house and lands in@ the hands@ of an estate agent 
5909,country properties were not selling well at@ the time
5910,# was the asking price and i was not surprised that the sale so to speak hung@ fire@ 
5911,however in@ the spring of # an offer was made@ which my son accepted
5912,this@ sale later fell through and it was not until@ the following@ august that wyvis hall was finally sold to@ a mr and mrs langan for the much improved figure of #
5913,as far@ as i know my son's personal acquaintance with@ wyvis hall was confined@ to@ my uncle's lifetime when # my wife and son and daughter frequently stayed with him
5914,after@ my uncle's death in@ april # he visited wyvis hall on@ perhaps two or at@ the most three separate@ occasions simply for the purpose of looking it over and reaching@ a decision about@ the disposal of furniture and effects
5915,i suppose it is possible that squatters or other vagrants took@ possession of the house between@ the time of my uncle's death and the sale of the property
5916,certainly my son never let it or allowed anyone to occupy it on@ either a temporary or permanent basis
5917,my son is at present on@ holiday in tenerife with his wife and daughter
5918,i cannot say precisely when i expect him to return though i should suppose in@ about@ a week from@ now
5919,it was all very small@ and quiet@ and low-key 
5920,the snippet in@ rufus's monday morning newspaper measured@ just an inch@ in@ depth@ 
5921,it answered@ the question he had asked himself and told@ him that the bones of a very young child had been found as well as those@ of a young woman
5922,this@ was not a shock@ 
5923,how could it be otherwise since this@ was wyvis hall and the pine wood and the animal cemetery
5924,to photograph the house for the news last night the cameraman must have stood just where he had stood himself on the edge of the lawn with@ his back to the cedar tree
5925,a popular
5926,mass-produced camera he had used but quite a good one
5927,one thing@ about@ zosie's pilfering she never stole rubbish@ 
5928,he had taken@ a picture of her after@ that@ and one of the animal cemetery 
5929,why is the grass always so short up@ here
5930,adam had asked
5931,rabbits i expect 
5932,why can't bloody@ rabbits come and eat my lawns
5933,adam always referred to@ my lawns my house my furniture
5934,it had got@ up@ rufus's nose@ a bit though adam had@ a perfect right to do this@ 
5935,it was his all of it and it went@ to@ his head@ rather
5936,nineteen-year-olds seldom inherit country mansions after@ all
5937,it must have been some time in@ august when i took@ those@ pictures rufus thought and a couple@ of weeks later it was all over@ 
5938,coincidentally as the community and their lives together broke@ up@ so@ did@ the weather
5939,it was raining intermittently all the time they were in the cemetery the pines bowing@ and shivering@ in the wind
5940,sometimes they had had to stop and take@ shelter under the closely planted-trees
5941,if the weather had held@ and still been hot and dry would they have dug deeper
5942,probably not
5943,in spite of the rain the earth was still hard iron@ 
5944,a sheet@ of rain had come down then a hard@ gusty shower@ while they were laying the squares of turf back@ in place and adam had said something about@ the rain making@ the grass grow quickly the rain being on@ their side@ 
5945,we should all go our separate@ ways as soon as we can rufus had said
5946,we should pack up now and go
5947,the spade and the fork they had hung up among the other tools in the stables
5948,they had packed and adam had locked up the house
5949,at@ some point@ rufus himself had taken the things out of the fridge and left the door open to defrost it
5950,adam closed the front door and stood there for a moment as if he could not wrench@ himself away
5951,so much of its beauty had been stripped@ from@ it by the whipping@ winds
5952,and by the neglect@ of the long@ hot summer
5953,a sudden gust of rain dashed@ against the red bricks that were already stained in@ patches by water
5954,the house that when he first saw it had to float@ on@ a raft@ of golden@ mist@ now lay@ in a wilderness amidst ragged@ grass and straggling@ bushes and trees dead from@ the heat
5955,dirty@ grey clouds tumbled@ across the sky above the slate roof now the only thing that shone@ glazed@ with rain
5956,but rufus admitted@ to@ himself that the beauties of nature and architecture had never meant@ much to@ him
5957,it was the heat and sunshine and privacy he liked
5958,and now he longed only to get away
5959,they all got into goblander and he drove away up@ the drift adam next to him the others in the back@ 
5960,the drift had become a tunnel@ of overgrowth that dripped water on to the roof of the van
5961,none of them allowed@ their eyes to turn@ towards the pine wood
5962,at the top they came out into uncompromising@ bright grey light the bleak hedgeless lane the flat meadows where here and there stunted trees squatted@ old@ men@ in@ cloaks@ 
5963,adam's simile not his thought rufus with@ a grimace
5964,no one asked where he was taking them
5965,no one spoke
5966,adam had hilbert's old golf-bag stuck between his legs and rufus guessed the gun was inside it
5967,they must have gone a good two miles before they met@ another car
5968,rufus overtook a bus going@ to colchester and dropped@ the two in the back@ so that they could catch@ it
5969,he took adam on to sudbury for him to catch@ a train there and at@ that@ point@ they parted
5970,adam got down from goblander and said
5971,for ever and for ever farewell rufus
5972,which was probably a quotation from@ something though rufus did not know what and thought fastidiously that it was in@ bad taste@ histrionic though just like adam
5973,take@ care said rufus and not looking back any more than he had done when they returned from the cemetery drove off round the town he had got to know so well over the stour bridge into essex heading for halstead and dunmow and ongar and london
5974,he never had seen any of them again
5975,there had been no need to pretend to turn aside
5976,briefly starting his fifth year in@ medical school something over@ thirteen months later he had wondered if shiva manjusri would be one of the incoming freshmen
5977,but no his intuition had been accurate@ 
5978,at@ any rate@ shiva's face was not among the several brown faces
5979,as for the others avoiding them had presented@ no problems 
5980,would they get in touch with him now
5981,no contingency plans@ had been made@ for this@ eventuality
5982,so long as there was no hunt@ for a missing girl they had felt@ themselves reasonably safe@ 
5983,their minds had not reached@ out@ to@ the terror of what had in@ fact happened
5984,none of them had been the kind of people who could have imagined devotion@ to@ a pet animal or according to it funerary rites
5985,it was shiva who had proposed the site
5986,they had congratulated him on@ his ingenuity
5987,ten years
5988,an ovarian cyst nothing to get upset@ about@ rufus told ms beauchamp
5989,she was thirty-two an editor with@ a distinguished publishing house married to@ an investigative journalist
5990,as yet they had@ no children but she wanted four she told rufus
5991,no reason why you shouldn't
5992,he had@ another glance at her notes
5993,in@ fact a peculiarity about@ this@ condition is that it seldom if ever occurs in@ a woman who's had@ a baby
5994,my god she said putting her coat on
5995,'and there was # making@ my husband's life a misery sure i'd got@ the dreaded c
5996,they all thought they'd got@ the dreaded c poor@ things@ 
5997,you couldn't blame them
5998,rufus took her # off her by the reception desk having set@ in@ train@ the arrangements by which she would be admitted@ to@ a fashionable west end clinic with@ rufus her surgery and her hospitalization ultimately paid for by some provident association to@ which she and her husband subscribed
5999,rufus shook hands
6000,he walked back@ to his consulting room dying@ for a cigarette
6001,this@ was unlike him
6002,he could usually get@ through@ quite easily until@ after@ lunch
6003,he thought i know what my idea of heaven would be if by heaven we mean a place of bliss in which to pass@ eternity a sanctuary where one might chain-smoke without@ impairment of breathing destruction of the lungs or damage to the heart light each fresh@ cigarette from the glowing butt@ of its predecessor@ and drink ice-free but hundred-proof chilled vodka laced@ with two drops of angostura and a gill of newly opened perrier endlessly with@ increasing euphoria until a peak@ of joy and ease was reached@ but without any sub-sequent nausea or pain or dehydration or oblivion
6004,sitting alone he lit his cigarette the first of the day and there came@ that@ faint@ swimming@ in@ the head a tautening of the gut
6005,he closed his eyes
6006,if it comes@ to@ light@ that i was in that@ house with adam and the others he thought with@ cold@ clarity@ if someone tells@ the papers or the police and thence the papers that i was there during the summer of # living there it will be all up@ with@ me
6007,i will lose@ my practice and my reputation and everything that i have@ and can look@ forward@ to@ if not my liberty
6008,and without@ the rest i shan't care about@ my liberty
6009,it would be bad enough if i were a g p or an expert in@ some other branch@ of medicine an orthopaedic surgeon for instance or an ear nose and throat man but i am a and it is the bones of a young woman and a baby that have been found there
6010,what worried woman would come to me
6011,what mrs strawson or ms beauchamp
6012,what gp would send her to me
6013,if i were innocent thought rufus i know very well what i would do
6014,i would pick up the phone and phone my solicitor and ask to come and see him and get@ his advice
6015,he might advise me to make@ a statement to@ the police which i should of course do under@ his guidance@ 
6016,but i shall not do this@ because i am not innocent
6017,i shall sit here and wait and sweat@ it out@ and look@ the facts in@ the face@ trying to anticipate the worst that can happen
6018,the wonderful thing@ about@ the human mind adam thought is the way@ it copes@ when the worst happens
6019,beyond@ that@ worst happening you think there can be nothing the unimaginable has taken@ place@ and on@ the other side@ is death destruction the end@ 
6020,but the worst happens and you reel@ from@ it you stagger@ the shock@ is enormous@ and then you begin to recover@ 
6021,you rally@ you stand@ up@ and face@ it
6022,
6023,an hour maybe and you are making@ contingency plans@ 
6024,for what had happened was not the worst you realized that@ 
6025,the worst was yet to come@ was perhaps always yet to come@ never would actually come@ because if it did you would know it that@ would be reality and there would be nothing then but to kill yourself
6026,quickly
6027,now that he was able to he assembled@ what had happened and laid@ the facts before@ himself
6028,they had dug up those@ bones at wyvis hall and had decided it was murder they were investigating
6029,bones skeletons bodies do not bury themselves
6030,those@ were the facts as far@ as he knew them up to@ this@ moment
6031,he would know more much more in@ the days to come@ 
6032,what was certain was that he could no longer use the escape key
6033,it was defunct
6034,the passages@ it cancelled had in@ any case as in@ certain programmes not been lost@ but stored@ on some limbo@ disc from@ whence they must now be retrieved@ 
6035,adam sat in his parents' house drinking tea
6036,there must be a total retrieval@ now the one good thing@ about@ which was that it might banish@ his dreams
6037,he was aware of a slight@ feeling of sickness and of cold an absence of hunger though he had been feeling@ quite hungry when he got off the plane
6038,anne sat next to him on his mother's cretonne-covered settee and abigail lay on a plaid rug on the floor kicking with her legs and punching with her arms
6039,his mother kept poking toys which she did not want at her
6040,a passage@ from@ a novel by john o'hara came@ back@ to@ adam
6041,he had memorized it years ago in@ the ecalpemos epoch the safest way@ to live is first inherit money second be born without@ taste@ for liquor third have@ a legitimate job that keeps you busy fourth marry a wife who will cooperate in@ your sexual peculiarities fifth join@ some big@ church sixth don't live too long
6042,apart from the last one which he hadn't got@ to@ yet and the penultimate one which seemed to apply in america more than here here he had joined@ the golf club he had complied with@ all the rest
6043,or his nature@ and luck had complied@ for him
6044,nemesis@ had@ still come@ down@ the wolf@ on@ the fold@ 
6045,he had not wanted to come back here
6046,but there had been no spirit@ in@ him the shock@ of what his father told him had been too great@ 
6047,something that will interest you adam something to make@ you sit@ up@ 
6048,they've dug up a lot@ of human bones at my old uncle's house 
6049,by@ the time he had rallied@ and got@ himself together@ and was thinking of things@ to say to@ the police it was too late and they were heading north
6050,anne was furious
6051,when lewis said to come back with him and eat there adam had got@ a kick on the ankle from anne and another kick when he hadn't replied
6052,he had turned@ on@ her and said with@ cold@ savagery for fuck's sake stop kicking me will you
6053,he expected his father to rise@ and say something about@ that@ being no way@ to speak to@ one's wife or not in front of the child he was capable of that@ 
6054,but he had said nothing only looked subdued and adam realized why
6055,his own terrible fear and anger had communicated@ itself to@ his father and shown@ him what the better part@ of valour was keeping silent
6056,having put@ the cat@ among@ the pigeons@ made@ mischief in@ his special way@ he was lying@ low@ now and waiting
6057,the old bastard@ 
6058,adam only wished uncle hilbert left@ him wyvis hall and then there would have been no ecalpemos no zosie and no deaths
6059,and adam couldn't see@ he would have been much worse off@ 
6060,he and anne would be living in a house like this@ one rather than that@ neo-georgian palace@ 
6061,children after@ all he thought looking at abigail were happy wherever they were so long as they were loved 
6062,his parents had not asked him what sort of holiday he had had@ or how the flight had been
6063,the conversation was exclusively on@ the subject@ of the discovery at wyvis hall
6064,adam did not know whether to be glad or sorry he had not obtained an english newspaper while away
6065,if he had done the shock@ would have been less but on@ the other hand@ his holiday would have been spoilt@ 
6066,he would have liked very much to be alone
6067,of course he knew there was no possibility of this@ now or when he returned home for when you were married you never could be alone
6068,presumably that@ was the point@ 
6069,what was he going to tell anne
6070,how much was he going to tell her
6071,he didn't know
6072,none of it if he could help@ it
6073,they sat at the table in the dining area to eat an absurdly early high@ tea
6074,lewis asked him if he could remember the day when he heard he had inherited wyvis hall and had walked in here and astounded them with@ his news
6075,he had a beard then anne
6076,lewis's subdued@ air@ had changed@ to@ one of high@ good humour
6077,you wouldn't have recognized him he looked john@ the baptist@ 
6078,adam could remember very well but he wasn't going@ to say so
6079,what a funny@ thing@ said lewis
6080,we had@ ham salad that@ day too
6081,what a coincidence
6082,oh yes i've been meaning to ask you who was it looked@ after@ wyvis hall while you were in greece
6083,adam could eat nothing
6084,the other time he remembered it was his father who hadn't been able to eat
6085,he didn't know what lewis meant about@ someone looking@ after@ the house but no doubt he adam had at@ the time concocted@ some tale@ to keep@ his father quiet to keep@ him away even
6086,someone from the village you said lewis persisted
6087,how can i remember that@ far@ back@ 
6088,the police will want to know
6089,it may be of vital@ importance
6090,aren't you going@ to eat your meat dear said beryl
6091,abigail who had been put upstairs in one of the bedrooms to sleep set@ up@ a wailing sound
6092,adam was on his feet at once 
6093,i think we should go
6094,they had to wait until his father was ready
6095,adam would have preferred to phone for a hire car but lewis wouldn't hear of it
6096,anne sat in the front in the passenger seat while adam was in the back@ with abigail
6097,if his father could have found out what flight they were coming on@ the police certainly could
6098,it was possible they might be waiting for him
6099,they would wish to interview every former owner or occupant of wyvis hall
6100,he looked again at the newspaper account@ of the adjourned inquest that his father had saved@ for him
6101,it would be owners and occupants of wyvis hall between@ nine and twelve years before that they would wish to interview and those@ were great-uncle hilbert who was dead himself and ivan langan to@ whom he had sold the house
6102,as for other occupants how would they know who else had lived there@ 
6103,it was ironical that ten days before he had seen shiva at heathrow
6104,the encounter he now saw@ an omen@ a shadow@ cast@ by a coming event
6105,what would that@ event be
6106,adam did not want at@ this@ point@ to speculate it made@ hi feel@ sick@ 
6107,he turned the newspaper over so that he could not see that@ headline and those@ paragraphs
6108,in@ high@ spirits@ his father was talking about@ the immense@ advances@ made@ in@ forensic science in@ recent years
6109,as soon as they got home anne started getting abigail to bed
6110,their cases humped upstairs and put into the bedroom adam looked rufus fletcher up in@ the phone book
6111,he was in@ there@ twice at@ a wimpole street number and again at@ an address in mill hill rufus h fletcher mb mrcp
6112,all these@ years then or for some of them rufus had been living three or four miles from him
6113,he couldn't look shiva up because he couldn't remember his surname
6114,women marry and change@ their names he thought there was no point@ in@ pursuing@ that@ one
6115,of course he could look up robin tatian but where@ really would that@ get@ him
6116,he was reaching-for the blue directory when anne came back with abigail in her arms so adam took her and carried her back@ to bed himself and tucked her in and kissed her
6117,she was almost asleep
6118,he wondered if rufus had@ children and if so did he worry@ about@ them coming@ to@ terrible harm the way@ adam worried@ 
6119,was his whole@ life affected by what had happened at ecalpemos
6120,adam might have escaped@ the file memories for years suppressed@ them and jerked@ violently away from@ them but he had never been able to pretend he was unscathed by those@ events
6121,sometimes he felt@ that he was the person he was because of them and acted the way@ he did because of their effects
6122,he sat by abigail's cot not wanting to remember but knowing that now he must
6123,there was nothing in his house to remind him of ecalpemos
6124,everything that was left everything he and rufus hadn't sold had gone@ to@ ivan langan with@ the house
6125,for a song@ too because he had not been able to bear@ the thought of going back meeting a valuer walking about the house picking things off shelves and out of cupboards
6126,only once had he returned after they all left and that@ had been bad enough a dream@ no stepping@ into@ the set@ and scenario@ of some frightening@ film@ a hitchcock@ movie@ perhaps
6127,he asked the taxi he had taken@ to put@ him down@ at the top@ of the drift and he had walked to the house
6128,it was almost a year since he had been there and in@ that@ time nothing had been done nothing had been touched
6129,from the pine wood he simply averted his eyes till@ later
6130,the drift was thickly overgrown a dank tunnel out of whose bushy sides the tendrils of brambles and briar roses caught@ at his clothes
6131,one of these@ whipped@ back@ at him and as he caught at it a thorn drove@ into the fleshy pad@ of his finger
6132,that@ thorn had been there festering for months
6133,a dull@ cool summer it had been as different as could be from@ the year before@ 
6134,no golden@ light bathed@ the red brick of the house
6135,it no longer looked mellow 
6136,beautiful yes but severe@ somehow and to@ adam's heightened awareness reproachful@ 
6137,he found@ himself encouraging@ fostering@ the scenario@ illusion
6138,only thus only by pretending unreality pretending this@ was a part@ he acted could he go on cross the wild shaggy@ grass go past the black-branched cedar tree arrive at the porch set in its four doric columns and insert his key in the lock
6139,conclusion
6140,task analysis has not and cannot be reduced@ to@ a set of standardised procedures which the aspiring analyst could acquire@ in@ a formal@ training@ course@ 
6141,the techniques just described are no more than guidelines in@ what remains the creative@ art of studying and describing what an experienced worker is doing or will be required to do
6142,the danger in@ being too rigid@ is that justice will not be done to@ the flexibility@ and complexity of human performance
6143,the danger of being too flexible@ is that the ergonomists will have@ an inadequate basis from@ which to design@ interfaces training@ courses@ and other operator aids
6144,if a comprehensive task description can be completed then it is legitimate to enquire why the task cannot be allocated to@ a technical device rather than a human being
6145,yet without a reasonably comprehensive task description the total system performance@ may be unreliable or unpredictable
6146,there is a necessary compromise which can only be arrived@ at@ in@ the context@ of a particular system
6147,as mentioned@ earlier there are always the twin@ problems of how to get@ the information and how to present@ it
6148,it is sometimes easier to proceed@ on@ the basis of if i were doing the job this@ is how i would do it but this@ can be delusory even for analysts who have@ past experience as operators
6149,for analysts who are designers creating@ a new task there may be no alternative but any task description arrived@ at@ by this@ method should be checked against@ the behaviour of real operators as they gain@ experience
6150,a particular difficulty about@ task synthesis@ is that there is no easy way@ of confirming completeness
6151,a task description which is part@ of a design@ process should be fully documented in terms of the origins@ of information the assumptions made@ and the methods used
6152,the standard method of producing@ task descriptions is to write all the separate sub-tasks at@ various levels@ on cards and then assemble@ the cards in@ a network@ 
6153,there is a temptation to make these@ final diagrams very large but often it is more useful to separate@ into@ small@ units@ with@ cross-referencing
6154,the optimum size seems to be a# this@ is easily copied and circulated@ but is large enough to contain@ considerable detail
6155,the procedure can be computerised there are programmes available for the easy production@ manipulation@ and storage@ of block@ diagrams with@ useful cross-referencing facilities@ 
6156,there is an inherent difficulty in@ that often the main dividend from@ a task analysis is from@ the act of obtaining it
6157,those@ not involved find@ it difficult to gain@ very much from@ a presentation of a task description
6158,like reference books they have to be used rather than read
6159,task analysis can be very expensive in@ skilled manpower but in@ looking@ at@ cost value it is important to include@ in@ value the increase in@ mutual understanding which occurs when a multi-disciplinary team conducts@ the analysis
6160,if such a team is usedthe required man-hours can be optimised byusingthe delphi method rather than a long@ series of group meetings
6161,political economic and social issues which arise@ in@ conducting@ task analyses are discussed@ in@ the context@ of job analysis p #
6162,application@ 
6163,man-power planning
6164,the humanresource@ concept of man-power as the central@ profitgenerating@ asset@ of any organisation has made@ some progress@ over@ the past twenty years
6165,there was particular interest around@ # when companies were prosperous stable@ and innovative ipm # patten #
6166,the objective is to revise and almost reverse@ the traditional accountancy concept of man-power as a resource@ consuming@ factor requiring regular payments overheads in@ the form@ of heated lighted equipped workspaces and so on
6167,from@ the narrow@ accountancy viewpoint@ people are a cost and it is desirable@ to keep@ this@ cost as low@ as possible
6168,in@ these@ terms it is very difficult to justify for example sending a member@ of staff on@ a training@ course@ 
6169,the training@ requires expenditure and so also does the replacement for the person away
6170,where@ is the return@ 
6171,the return@ is actually in@ the improved humanresource@ but this@ is not readily measurable in@ terms which accountants use 
6172,there have been two attempts to reduce@ humanresources@ to@ this@ form@ of measurement@ giles and robinson #
6173,one is to acquire@ a humanasset@ multiplier for each level@ of staff
6174,the multiplier for manual staff might be unity but it increases with@ staff level@ and becomes three or more for management
6175,the other is to add together@ all the personnel costs for each kind of worker from@ the original job advertisement through@ to@ the retirement or redundancy payments
6176,the first does attempt@ to obtain@ a value the second remains essentially a cost and not a value
6177,it would be unduly optimistic to assume@ that management skills have risen@ to@ a level@ such that costs undertaken@ can be assumed@ to be equivalent to@ value
6178,a less direct@ measure@ which is applicable only to@ the most senior@ management is to observe the fall@ or rise@ of the share price when a particular executive leaves@ or joins@ a company
6179,this@ can be very high@ for a large@ company a change in@ market@ value of millions of pounds is not unusual 
6180,the most serious@ consequence of the accountancy view@ of man-power is that high@ level@ policy decision-making does not give@ this@ factor sufficient weight@ 
6181,for example the main board of a company will have@ complete details of cost and values of physicalresources@ such as buildings and equipment but relatively scanty@ data about@ the man-power which is their most important asset@ 
6182,indeed it will be described@ almost entirely as a liability because the costs will be known
6183,similarly broad@ factors such as the state@ of morale will again only be described bynegative@ features@ such as absenteeism stoppages strikes@ low@ quality output and so on
6184,it is obvious that company output and projects must reflect@ the man-power and its performance@ level@ but if this@ is acknowledged at all it is only in@ brief@ verbal terms within@ for example the chairman's annual report
6185,the obsession of current management with@ measurement and the reduction@ of every variable to@ numbers for ease of computer manipulation@ has worsened the situation@ 
6186,unfortunately there is no easy remedy@ 
6187,humanresources@ are too complex a variable to be easily susceptible@ to@ measurement beyond@ the level@ of counting heads and trades
6188,key variables such as the quality of staff at@ any level@ and the current morale are only expressible@ in general verbal descriptive terms
6189,it is generally acceptedp # that hygiene type variables such as pay and working conditions can if they are inappropriately specified depress@ morale and motivation but they will not in@ themselves result in@ very high@ levels@ of these@ parameters
6190,morale and motivation are influenced more by conditions of work in@ the sense of work variety opportunities and attitudes@ of management
6191,these@ factors are worthy of emphasis@ because in@ practice they are still dealt@ with@ very badly in@ many organisations and yet it takes@ little trouble or expertise to make@ an enormous difference
6192,for example very few senior@ managements take@ the trouble to keep@ workers fully informed about@ policies and likely changes
6193,the result is excessive reliance on@ rumour and continuous@ speculation which is not only time-consuming but is also highly deleterious in@ morale terms
6194,the two human factors which can be unambiguously measured@ are age and sex
6195,the age distribution@ of a work force is always an interesting and important source@ of information
6196,for most purposes a rectangular@ distribution@ is the most desirable because it provides the appropriate mix@ of youthful enthusiasm and ageing@ experience
6197,it also makes@ for regular changes as staff retire@ and are replaced@ 
6198,many distributions@ show@ a peak@ in@ a particular age group@ mainly associated with@ taking on a large@ number of young people when the organisation was started or reorganised this@ is not desirable@ because it leads@ to@ excessive competition for promotion at@ particular stages@ 
6199,these@ comments are obviously most relevant for work forces where@ there is little tendency to move out this@ is characteristic of a surprisingly large@ number of organisations in european countries and in japan but much less so in the usa
6200,stable@ work forces have@ their advantages in terms of familiarity@ with@ the enterprise and its peculiar needs but they do result in@ problems if the market@ for the products is erratic or otherwise unpredictable
6201,this@ is particularly so in@ high@ technology eg design and construction of ships aircraft power stations and chemical plant@ where@ the product unit is large and expensive and the variety of required expertise is extensive@ 
6202,some peaks@ of demand can be dealt@ with@ byusing@ consultants but they tend to be expensive and do not always fit@ well with@ ill-defined but important factors such as the favoured style of the organisation
6203,in@ well ordered systems it may be possible to calculate the length@ of in-house experience required to achieve the required level@ of expertise in@ particular topics and compare this@ with@ the lead time for particular product requirements
6204,given time available to train@ new staff it is not necessary to keep@ more than a nucleus@ in@ that@ particular expertise
6205,on@ the other hand@ if there is usually insufficient notice of need it may be necessary to keep@ staff who have@ periods with@ little@ to do between@ projects
6206,it is also desirable to have@ the possibility of shifting@ staff between@ design and operational duties
6207,this@ not only provides flexibility@ in@ the useof man-power it also improves communication
6208,these@ real difficulties of man-power utilisation are such as to force@ many organisations to become larger@ and larger@ if they are to remain economic
6209,size@ provides a cushion@ to@ the vicissitudes of markets@ but it creates other problems
6210,for example difficulties of communications and in particular how to inculcate the feeling@ within@ each individual that he and his performance are important to@ the organisation
6211,this@ is considered in@ more detail in@ chapter #
6212,humanresources@ should be fundamental to@ subjects@ such as ergonomics which are essentially people-centred@ but the concept remains procedurally undevelopedat@ any level@ from@ a continent through@ countries regions and companies down@ to@ particular working systems
6213,this@ is one reason why policy makers@ never seem to take@ account@ fully of the people affected by their decisions
6214,the design@ of procedures
6215,the increased importance of standardised informational support@ for both machines and operators has led@ to@ the concept of procedures as a separate design@ issue within@ a system fig #
6216,much of this@ information can be incorporated in@ computer programs but there is also a need for extensive@ printed paper for the use of the operator
6217,this@ takes@ three main forms@ checklists routines and knowledge-texts
6218,the terminology in@ this@ field@ is not standardised
6219,software might be restricted@ as in@ this@ book to@ computer programs but it is sometimes usedas the generic term to include@ all sources@ of information
6220,procedures is sometimes usedfor what are here@ called routines and sometimes to indicate all the operator's information support@ except software
6221,the situation@ is further@ confused@ when some but not all the operator information support@ is itself computer-based@ 
6222,sometimes the term firm-ware is used
6223,however whatever the terminology usedthere is a requirement for design@ effort
6224,the quality of procedures would be much improved if designers followed@ some simple@ guide-lines table #
6225,many documents are written on@ the implicit assumption that the reader is much like the writer in terms of expertise and style of thinking
6226,similarly it is assumed@ that the conditions under@ which the reading will take@ place@ are the same as those@ of writing which are usually a clean well-lit office
6227,they may have to be read in the open air in rain and darkness or within a plant@ under@ oily cramped poorly lit conditions
6228,the user probably has@ limited expertise and he may be working under@ various stress@ conditions
6229,the material on which the information is printed the typeface used the sequence the structure@ and the format generally should reflect@ the conditions of use easterby and zwaga #
6230,all these@ things@ can be achieved if it is acknowledged that all procedures should a validated by users under@ the normal conditions of use
6231,checklists
6232,checklists are used in@ the pre-start mode for routine maintenance and for fault-finding
6233,they normally take@ the form@ of a series of questions or statements which the operator uses to guide@ and structure his inspection of the hardware and other system components
6234,the sequence is dictated@ bythe optimal order in@ which actions should be taken@ for example in@ starting up an aircraft
6235,there are many situations@ when the order is of no great@ consequence for example a safety audit of a new machine and in@ this@ latter case some logical structure@ is needed
6236,as mentioned@ above@ the logic of the design@ may not be the optimal basis if the way@ the operator thinks and acts is different
6237,baker # suggests that four kinds of shortcoming emerge@ when checklists are validated in@ the real situation@ 
6238,the operator may deviate from@ the listed procedure because it may require excessive moving about or because he is interrupted by the requirements of other tasks
6239,systematic use of a checklist often reveals@ faults in@ work design@ such as inadequate access@ visibility and labelling
6240,the checklist itself may be inconsistent incomplete imprecise or ambiguous
6241,finally the checklist may have@ reprographic limitations such as inadequate vertical@ or horizontal@ structure@ poor@ typefaces and insufficient linking@ of requirements descriptions remarks and tick-off points@ 
6242,the international ergonomics association developeda general ergonomics checklist which is reproduced@ in@ edholm #
6243,there is a deceptive simplicity about@ such lists which requires extensive@ effort to ensure a comprehensive but coherent content@ 
6244,the context@ is of course the context@ of ergonomics as conceived@ by the designers of the list
6245,routines
6246,a routine is the most common form@ of instructional material@ 
6247,the reader is required to follow@ a series of steps@ which might for example introduce@ a change in@ the performance@ of a complex system
6248,normally routines are single chains@ of instructions although it is possible to have@ some conditional branching@ 
6249,each step@ should be simple@ and complete in@ itself preferably with@ some indication that successful completion has been achieved for example the appearance or the change of colour of a signal light or the noise of a motor starting or a change of pressure which indicates that there has been a change in@ the flow@ of some material
6250,as mentioned earlier a routine can often be regarded@ as a written task description
6251,by definition and design@ intention routines are inflexible@ 
6252,the user is intended to behave exactly according to their instruction
6253,no great@ skill or intellectual effort is required which is one way@ of saying@ that the human operator is being under-used@ but the purpose of a routine is usually to avoid@ common human error such as omitting a step@ or reversing@ steps@ 
6254,in general the value of formal@ routines is precisely that the operator left@ to@ himself will not normally function in@ such a systematic sequential manner
6255,knowledge texts
6256,knowledge is contained@ in@ documents which may vary from@ single sheet presentations to@ large@ manuals
6257,as instructional material@ it is indirect@ in that the reader is not necessarily told@ what to do as in@ a routine
6258,rather he is informed about@ the situation@ and the purpose of informing him is to provide a knowledge base@ from@ which he can work out his own actions
6259,nevertheless the relevant action remains important and the knowledge provided should be carefully and stringently selected
6260,it is too easy to follow@ the academic tradition and provide knowledge for its own sake
6261,the need to know criterion is crucial because unless it is applied@ the operator can be overburdened with@ unnecessary material@ 
6262,correspondingly the material@ should be structured in terms of how it is most likely to be used
6263,in@ this@ context@ the operator requires a guide@ for action and not a scientific text-book
6264,it is invariably better to provide material@ diagrammatically systematically or at least in@ well-structured short@ paragraphs rather than in@ flowing@ prose
6265,consider@ for example how readily information about@ the relative position of streets is available from@ a map of a town centre@ rather than a verbal description of all the streets
6266,such a map will enable the reader to work out for himself how to get from one location to another within the town
6267,note@ the enormous@ flexibility@ compared with@ a routine which would tell@ him only how to get from one particular point@ to another
6268,a second important difference is that if he misses his place in@ a routine he will be totally lost@ whereas if he happens to go in@ the wrong direction while using a map he is still able to make@ whatever correction@ is necessary
6269,however the map does require more intellectual effort than does the routine not only in@ making@ decisions about@ how to proceed@ but also in@ filtering@ out@ the required information from@ the massive@ irrelevance for a particular task which is equally available
6270,thus one would expectthe use of the maps to be slower than the use of routines with@ the human performance being more versatile but less predictable
6271,with@ two-dimensional representations such as maps it remains important to avoid@ too much homogeneity and provide substructure@ in@ the form@ of main roads and key buildings or other features@ such as rivers
6272,see for example fig #
6273,manuals which may contain@ maps schematic diagrams and other materials@ warrant@ separate consideration
6274,the design@ of manuals
6275,a manual is usually in@ the form@ of a book or booklet which is sent with the hardware from the maker to the customer
6276,it is part of the communication package from the designer to the user
6277,thus it is a particular form@ of job aid which provides the operator with@ information on@ a system and its performance
6278,the standard@ of manual design@ has traditionally been very low@ for several reasons
6279,for this@ purpose the designer is too familiar with@ the product and he rarely takes@ the trouble to find out what the user really needs to know
6280,often the manual has to be provided hurriedly at@ the end@ of a project when the budget is running@ out@ and it is regarded@ as a tiresome chore still required after the essential design@ work has been completed
6281,the problem is particularly acute for computers
6282,manuals for cars machine tools and so on are poor@ but at least it is possible to observe the mechanisms and their functions
6283,most computer operators do not know or wish to know about@ the mechanisms and in@ any case these@ are not accessible@ to@ vision and manipulation
6284,the computer operator is entirely dependent on@ the manual at least in@ the early stages@ of gaining familiarity with@ the system and its functions
6285,he is usually very badly served@ although the principles of manual design@ are well known
6286,for most systems the manual is best divided@ into@ parts@ as indicated in@ table #
6287,the first part@ should be a general introduction@ which orientates the readers towards@ the system its purpose its functional structure@ and mode of operation and its performance limits@ 
6288,this@ should be followed@ bya separate section@ on@ how to set@ the system up@ in@ the first place@ and how to check that it is working@ properly
6289,if it is fairly small it may be necessary to describe how to unpack it fix it into@ position connect it to power@ supplies and start it up
6290,if it is large the emphasis@ will be on@ the start up procedure
6291,the section@ describing@ the operation of the system should cover@ not only how the system operates but also how the user can operate it
6292,extensive@ useof line drawings schematic diagrams algorithmic lists is desirable@ and where@ prose is usedthis@ also should be structured into@ short@ sentences with@ meaningful separation into@ paragraphs
6293,the maintenance section@ should indicate what if anything the operator is expected to do and the symptoms@ which indicate that more specialist maintenance skills are required
6294,tables subdivided into@ faults reasons remedies@ can be extremely helpful
6295,parts lists including@ description reference numbers and sometimes drawings are necessary if the user is expected to deal@ with@ his own replacements
6296,a standard fault is to assume@ that the reader is familiar with@ the jargon which the designer habitually uses
6297,a glossary of terms and acronyms usedcan be very helpful not only to@ the reader but also to@ the writer who is forced@ to consider@ carefully how he is using various technical terms
6298,finally all manuals should end with@ an index which supplements the table of contents@ at@ the beginning 
6299,the school framework@ 
6300,a model@ to link@ personality characteristics to@ a preference for science
6301,john head
6302,introduction@ 
6303,in@ recent years there has been a steady@ accumulation of evidence that personality and allied affective factors play@ a crucial role@ in@ determining subject@ choice and student success
6304,unfortunately this@ evidence has tended to be fragmentary a collection@ of separate@ discrete pieces@ of information lacking a synthesizing@ theory to provide cohesion and predictive power@ 
6305,the few models@ which have been developedto@ date may have been correct as far@ as they go@ but are clearly incomplete
6306,for example roe # eiduson # and mcclelland # suggested that male scientists often experienced a lonely@ childhood perhaps suffering social isolation@ through@ illness or family circumstances so that they developed a strong@ interest in@ their surrounding material world@ and a below@ average interest@ in@ other people and relationships
6307,maslow # and hudson # and # saw@ science as providing an emotionally undemanding@ activity appealing@ to@ boys moving@ from@ the calm of latency to@ the turbulence@ of adolescence
6308,even if these@ descriptions are valid they still leave@ open@ a number of questions@ particularly why the same mechanisms@ do not operate@ with@ girls
6309,arising@ from@ the evidence in@ the literature and from@ our empirical studies at chelsea college it is now possible to offer a model@ which is compatible with@ all the evidence and which also has@ considerable predictive potential 
6310,what we know about@ persons choosing science
6311,the evidence for an association@ between@ personality characteristics and an interest@ in@ science has been more fully reviewed by head #
6312,we need now only take@ note@ of the most salient features@ 
6313,the most obvious one is that@ of sex differences
6314,the predominance of males particularly in@ the physical sciences and engineering throughout@ the western world can no longer be satisfactorily attributed to@ cognitive differences which are too small@ nor to@ institutional factors
6315,equal opportunity in@ education and employment has not made@ science any more popular with@ women
6316,furthermore the characteristics of those@ students who do opt for science show@ clear@ sex differences
6317,male scientists both science students and mature@ professional scientists tend to be emotionally reticent disliking overt emotional expression in@ others and themselves and depending upon@ their partners in@ personal relationships to take@ the emotional initiatives
6318,they will also tend to be authoritarian conservative and controlled in@ their thinking
6319,these@ differences can be seen@ quite early on@ we have found@ boys aged # years who were opting for science to be significantly more authoritarian than their peers
6320,girls choosing science are not particularly emotionally reticent or rigid@ in@ their thinking although they do seem to have@ low@ self-esteem in terms of being socially and sexually attractive
6321,we also know that at@ about@ the age of # a very high@ proportion@ of boys are attracted@ to@ science and scientific careers
6322,thereafter there is a steady@ decline of interest@ in@ science and this@ disillusionment extends@ right through@ the secondary-school years and into@ the undergraduate period
6323,in@ contrast@ only a minority of girls express@ an interest@ in@ science at@ any age but there is no obvious swing@ from@ science in@ the middle@ and late teens
6324,some further evidence has come@ from@ our useof sentence completion tests with@ secondary-school pupils@ as part@ of our research programme at chelsea
6325,analysis of these@ responses@ provides further information on@ sex differences and between@ those@ opting for different subjects@ 
6326,for example girls at@ the age of # and # years seem to take@ a more mature@ attitude@ to@ personal relationships seeing@ their complexity and reciprocal nature@ while boys are more exploitative
6327,in relation to the sentence stem@ a girl and her mother girls often produce@ responses@ like often go@ through@ a bad patch@ for a year but once they learn to understand each other become the best of friends or can help each other with@ their problems
6328,similar questions when asked of boys tend to produce@ banal responses or exploitative ones for example the parent is seen@ as the source@ of money
6329,in@ contrast@ boys seem to have@ a firmer@ self-identity and a clearer@ ambition showing@ more insight in response to sentence stems@ such as my main problem is and he she felt@ proud that
6330,such findings give@ us some clues about@ the characteristics of boys and girls of these@ ages
6331,if we compare boys of # years of age who opt for science with@ other boys we find@ that the former have@ very cut-and-dried views@ on@ many issues
6332,for example they take@ the view@ that criminals should be severely punished or that anyone who is unpopular deserves his fate
6333,to@ the sentence stem@ when a child will not join@ in@ group activities these@ boys gave@ responses like he is selfish he must be stupid he deserves to be unpopular
6334,in@ contrast@ other boys and most girls pondered the possible causes and ways@ of integrating the child into@ the group
6335,the science boys seemed to possess@ few doubts or uncertainties they offered clear-cut answers
6336,it was this@ evidence which suggested@ the possible model@ for subject@ choice in terms of ego-identity achievement
6337,ego-identity in@ adolescence
6338,this@ model@ was originally postulated by erikson # and then developed by marcia # and #
6339,erikson suggests@ that at@ different phases@ of life an individual faces@ a particular psycho-social problem which needs to be resolved before@ moving@ on@ to@ the next@ phase@ 
6340,for adolescents the acquisition@ of a clear@ ego-identity is the crucial task
6341,at@ the beginning of adolescence the individual is a within@ the family and the school
6342,by@ the end@ of adolescence he or she needs to make@ choices about@ career life-style personal relationships and ideologies
6343,the ego-identity of that@ person is shaped@ bythese@ choices
6344,erikson does not suggest that the development of an ego-identity is a once-and-for-all issue
6345,some problems about@ identity arise@ with@ the young child in@ the context@ of home and school and others occur in@ later life for example on@ retirement
6346,nevertheless adolescence is the time when ego-identity development inevitably dominates@ the personal development of the individual for a while
6347,the adolescent does not however need to achieve a clear@ ego-identity on@ all topics at@ one time
6348,he or she may have@ a clear@ identity in@ respect to@ his or her career but still be unresolved in regard to personal relationships and ideology
6349,in@ this@ article we are concerned with@ ego-identity achievement in@ respect to@ career
6350,marcia has put@ more detail@ onto@ the erikson model@ and suggests that in@ going@ from@ the initial ego-diffusion@ condition@ to@ that@ of having achieved ego-identity two processes are involved and 
6351,crisis@ in@ this@ context@ describes@ a period of intensive self-examination@ in@ which one's beliefs and values@ are re-examined
6352,commitment means@ that the individual has@ acquired@ clear@ and firm@ beliefs both about@ himself or herself and the world
6353,figure # indicates@ a number of possible routes@ to@ ego-identity achievements
6354,a person may undergo crisis@ and commitment simultaneously and progress@ byroute@ a an alternative is to undergo a period of considerable self-doubt and self-examination@ in@ which all one's beliefs tend to be very fluid@ a period known as moratorium before@ acquiring@ beliefs for oneself and ego-identity is achieved route@ b
6355,a further possibility is that the individual may at least for a time hold@ onto@ beliefs and values@ taken@ without@ question from@ others for example parents teachers peers
6356,this@ condition@ is known as foreclosure@ 
6357,eventually these@ persons might have to face up to period of crisis@ of self-examination@ and so achieve ego-identity byroute@ c however foreclosure@ does offer@ an escape@ route@ and an individual might postpone indefinitely any real self-examination@ byclinging@ rigidly@ to@ his or her beliefs and values@ route@ d
6358,ego-identity and choosing science
6359,we can now make@ the link@ between@ this@ model@ of adolescent development and subject@ choice in@ schools
6360,for boys at@ the foreclosure@ stage@ science is likely to be appealing
6361,the physical sciences in particular offer@ a conventional career choice which is likely to win@ approval from@ parents teachers and peers
6362,they will tend to regard@ the overt expression of emotions including much such expression in@ the arts as being soft@ and feminine
6363,science with@ its masculine image@ makes@ little emotional demand@ on@ an individual and seems to offer@ clear@ precise answers@ to@ problems
6364,opting for science will permit@ and possibly reinforce@ emotional reticence
6365,for a girl at@ the foreclosure@ stage@ the situation@ is very different
6366,there is evidence that girls tend to be socialized into@ adult roles@ more through@ their potential of becoming a mother and housewife than through@ their career douvan and adelson #
6367,furthermore these@ girls will tend to go@ into@ a career with@ a feminine image@ one which already attracts@ many girls
6368,consequently very few girls at@ the foreclosure@ stage@ will enter@ science unless they receive considerable encouragement and a model@ to do so from@ their parents and their school
6369,neither boys nor girls at@ the moratorium stage@ are likely to be attracted@ to@ the science that is usually presented@ in@ our schools
6370,they are at@ a stage@ when they are likely to be concerned with@ a variety of complex issues the meaning of life the existence of god ideologies their emerging sexuality their future career and life-style too often science is seen@ as being purely instrumental with@ nothing to contribute@ to@ these@ debates
6371,science somehow seems to be scarcely relevant to@ the most important issues in@ our life
6372,a proportion@ of both boys and girls at@ ego-identity achievement stage@ will choose@ science
6373,in@ fact most girls entering@ science are probably at@ this@ stage@ as they will need some self-examination@ and sense of commitment to make@ this@ unconventional choice
6374,however only a minority of adolescents will have reached@ the ego-identity achievement stage@ at@ the age when most pupils@ have to make@ crucial decisions about@ subject@ choice at@ school
6375,this@ model@ seems to explain@ our observations@ 
6376,a large@ number of boys particularly at@ the foreclosure@ stage@ are initially attracted@ to@ science but there is a drift@ away@ throughout@ later adolescence as they undergo some crisis@ 
6377,the preponderance of boys at@ the foreclosure@ stage@ will yield@ the rigid@ authoritarian attitudes@ often associated with@ scientists
6378,the few girls who enter@ science will not usually show these@ foreclosure@ characteristics
6379,effects of curriculum changes@ 
6380,the real useof this@ model@ linking@ personality development to@ subject@ choice is that it allows@ us to make@ predictions about@ how pupils@ might react@ to@ changes@ in@ school science curriculum and school organization
6381,we can consider@ three possible changes@ 
6382,#
6383, britain is unusual in@ asking pupils@ to make@ crucial choices about@ subject@ options in@ the ## age range@ 
6384,these@ decisions can only be reversed@ with@ great@ difficulty
6385,what effect would delayingthe choice make@ 
6386,in@ the development through@ the years of adolescence the number of foreclosure@ pupils@ will diminish hence the recruitment of boys into@ science would be cut@ 
6387,more boys and girls will have reached@ the ego-identity achievement stage@ and a proportion@ of these@ will go@ into@ science
6388,overall there would be a reduction@ in@ the number of students choosing science but those@ who so choose will be more likely to stay@ happily in@ the subject@ and to possessmore flexible@ minds
6389,the quantitative loss would be met@ bya qualitative improvement
6390,#
6391, it is sometimes argued that science textbooks are sexist in@ showing@ illustrations of boys rather than girls doing practical work in the laboratory and so forth
6392,what effect would a deliberate attempt to change@ this@ image@ have@ 
6393,it might make@ it easier for girls at@ the foreclosure@ stage@ to accept science so recruitment might increase
6394,some of these@ girls might however drift@ away@ again when they reach@ their crisis@ period
6395,unless the change@ in@ image@ was immense boys would probably not be affected science would still be an obvious acceptable choice for a boy
6396,overall there would be some increase in@ the recruitment of girls but no qualitative improvement
6397,#
6398, to obtain a major qualitative improvement to@ recruitment in@ science with@ more girls and with@ students possessing@ imaginative flexible@ minds it would be necessary to make@ science appealing to@ boys and girls at@ the moratorium stage@ 
6399,in@ that@ event science must be seen@ to be relevant to@ the issues which concern them
6400,the probable implication is that science would need to be presented@ in@ the context@ of the needs of society and individuals
6401,probably a case-study approach@ involving the application@ of science and the interaction@ with@ other disciplines would be needed
6402,our knowledge about@ the girls' concern with@ personal relationships suggests@ that the introduction of some elements@ of the social sciences into@ the case studies might prove attractive@ 
6403,is it possible to change@ school science in@ this@ fashion@ and still preserve@ the essential character@ of science itself
6404,clearly there would need to be some drastic pruning@ of content
6405,perhaps science teachers should not attempt to cover@ their subjects@ so comprehensively
6406,a history teacher is content to cover@ the history of one country or continent over@ a few decades
6407,perhaps we must make@ similar choices
6408,it is interesting to notice that the association for science education # policy statement in britain and the proposals on@ school physics coming@ from@ the institute for science education ipn in kiel are advocating@ such changes@ 
6409,the difference is that we are now offering a formal@ psychological model@ to suggest that if we want to reduce@ the current encapsulation@ of science if we want to recruit@ a different sort of student then certain curriculum changes@ are needed 
6410,girl friendly science and the girl friendly school
6411,judith whyte
6412,approximately three times as many boys as girls take@ o levelphysics and approximately four times as many take@ cse physics
6413,over@ # per cent of entries@ in@ all technical subjects@ are from@ boys
6414,this@ means@ that schoolgirls are ineligible for a wide@ range@ of courses@ in@ further and higher@ education and for entry@ to@ occupations@ requiring a scientific or technical base@ 
6415,female exclusion from@ science and technology even if it is apparently by girls' own choice also means@ that as citizens their ability to understand and control@ their environment is limited
6416,nevertheless most schools consider@ they are already providing equal opportunities byneutral@ treatment of the two sexes bloomfield #
6417,in@ effect ignoring the effects of gender in@ this@ way@ merely reinforces@ stereotyping because it does@ nothing to challenge@ the definition of certain aspects@ of the curriculum as masculine or feminine
6418,girls into science and technology gist was the first major schools-based project addressing@ problems of sex stereotyping at school and was an example of action research in@ education the project simultaneously took@ action to improve girls' achievement in@ science and technology and investigated@ the reasons for their under-achievement
6419,the project team collaborated@ with@ teachers in@ eight co-educational comprehensive schools in the greater manchester area to devise and implement intervention strategies designed@ to improve girls' attitudes@ to@ the physical sciences and technical subjects@ 
6420,two other schools were involved as controls@ where attitude@ testing but no interventions took@ place@ 
6421,the approach@ was collaborative teachers were invited to work with@ the team as equal partners in@ the attempts both to investigate and find@ solutions to@ the gist problem
6422,however very few of the teachers even recognized@ the issue as one of professional concern at@ the start@ of the project and most of the first two years was spent@ in@ establishing the educational importance of the issue and working towards@ the development of feasible intervention strategies
6423,the project and its outcomes have been fully describedelsewhere@ smail 
6424,# kelly whyte and smail # whyte in@ press
6425,gist had@ more success in@ alteringchildren's attitudes@ than their subject@ choices suggesting that it is easier to change@ attitudes@ and beliefs than actual behaviour
6426,pupils@ in@ action schools became markedly less stereotyped than pupils@ in control@ schools
6427,they also had@ slightly more positive attitudes@ towards@ science and scientists and were less likely to define@ them as exclusively masculine
6428,despite some evidence of change@ in@ teachers' attitudes@ behaviour they themselves were reluctant to admit@ that the project had influenced them
6429,according to an evaluation report this@ may reflect@ an unwillingness to admit@ that in@ the past schools have been sex biased payne cuff and hustler #
6430,the gist hypothesis was that female under-achievement in@ science and technology is at least partly socially constructed@ by the school an hypothesis based@ on@ research evidence as well as critical feminist analysis see@ for example kelly #
6431,during the project there was a shift@ away from@ locating@ the issue as one of girls' motivation towards@ attempts to change@ the nature@ of school science
6432,one of the main gains from@ the gist project has been the clarification of what is meant@ bya girl friendly science that is a science which will appeal@ equally to@ the interests@ and concerns of girls as well as boys 
6433,making@ science more girl friendly
6434,several interventions were designed@ to make@ science more girl friendly
6435,schools and teachers tried@ curriculum development to build@ on@ girls' science interests@ changing@ patterns@ of classroom interaction single sex groups and classes
6436,the largest@ scale@ intervention was the vista programme which consisted of women scientists and technologists visiting schools to talk to@ children about@ an aspect@ of their jobs already being covered@ in@ the school science syllabus
6437,vista made@ science more girl friendly in@ two ways@ both boys and girls were offered an attractive@ image@ of a competent woman scientist and talks concentrated@ on@ social and industrial applications@ of science an element@ too often missing from@ science at@ school
6438,one school was so impressed by the children's positive reactions@ that they completely revamped the science work in@ the first two years to include@ more social and human applications@ of science
6439,the survey@ of children's attitudes@ helped@ here@ research such as ormerod's # ormerod and duckworth # had shown@ that girls were interested in@ the social implications of science but did not tell teachers what the desirable teaching approach@ might be in@ practice
6440,would science in@ the home@ be a starter@ 
6441,a question from@ our survey@ asked@ children whether they would like to know more about@ how a vacuum cleaner works hardly anyone did and girls were even less curious than boys
6442,this@ told@ us that any simplistic assumptions about@ featuring female domestic interests@ in@ science would probably meet@ with@ failure
6443,the rest of the questionnaire about@ science curiosity showed@ that all the children were enthusiastic about@ learning science and that girls were keen@ to know more about@ nature the environment and medical science
6444,over@ # per cent and in@ some cases over@ # per cent said they would like to learn about@ the human heart germs and illnesses how our muscles work@ what food is good for you life in the sea what makes@ a rainbow appear and how a record is made
6445,it was helpful that these@ topics also interested boys
6446,at present the science curriculum is structured@ around@ physical science interests@ on@ which boys are keener@ how motor cars work@ atoms and molecules we were able to recommend that teaching build@ on@ the overlapping@ interests@ of the two sexes because girls as well as boys want to know more about@ human biology and spectacular features@ of the environment animals in the jungle volcanoes and earthquakes acids and chemicals
6447,the less immediately attractive@ parts@ of science could be approached@ through@ these@ interests@ for instance teaching forces bybeginning with@ the action@ of muscles in the human arm and light via@ the dissection of a bull's eye
6448,when women scientists employ such approaches@ and describe their own work as happened during the vista programme girls are receiving double@ encouragement
6449,these@ examples indicate@ some of the features@ of girl friendly science it builds@ on@ girls' interests@ not just boys' it explicitly encourages@ girls to see@ themselves as potential scientists and it includes@ some of the social and human implications and applications@ of science
6450,other gist interventions
6451,all the gist schools were mixed comprehensives and at first teachers were most unwilling to separate boys and girls at all on@ the grounds that it ran@ counter to@ their co-educational comprehensive philosophy
6452,then certain teachers were particularly struck@ bythe evidence of large@ differences in@ the interests@ and experience children brought@ with@ them to school
6453,girls had@ far@ less tinkering experience than boys and the connection@ with@ their lesser interest@ in@ topics like how electricity is produced seemed obvious
6454,several special science or craft clubs were organized in@ the lunch hour for girls only and in two schools teachers planned@ single-sex teaching
6455,as we shall see@ it was in@ these@ two schools that the largest@ measurable changes@ of attitude@ and option choice occurred
6456,for a more girl friendly science it seems vital@ that teachers should come@ to see@ that when all the masculine packaging@ evident in@ textbooks and resources@ as well as teachers' and boys' behaviour in the classroom is removed@ girls can be very enthusiastic about@ science 
6457,alison kelly sees@ at least four distinct@ senses in@ which it can be argued that science is masculine
6458,first the pupils@ teachers and practitioners of science are overwhelmingly male in terms of numbers second school science is packaged@ and presented@ to appeal@ to@ boys not girls third classroom behaviours and interaction operate@ to reconstruct@ science as a male activity and finally it has been suggested that scientific thinking embodies an intrinsically masculine world@ view@ 
6459,the gist interventions describedabove@ relate to three of these@ vista women albeit briefly and temporarily redressed the numerical balance@ byoffering female role models of practising scientists vista and the curriculum developmentwhich followed@ involved a limited repackaging@ of science to remove@ its exclusively masculine appeal@ and the single-sex classes and classroom observation showed@ how science comes@ to be defined@ as masculine in@ the mixed school
6460,the fourth point@ the idea that science is intrinsically masculine can be sustained@ only by clinging@ to@ an irredeemably narrow@ conception of science and scientific thinking
6461,the industrial and social impact@ of science on@ health on@ people on@ the environment a focus@ on@ the beauty and complexity of the natural world are notable omissions from@ the school science syllabus
6462,girls are not uninterested in@ science they are bored bythe limited version@ of it they meet@ in@ school
6463,one of the purposes of an extended@ period of single-sex science teaching might be to let teachers see@ how girls approach@ scientific matters and to discover@ what may well be the case that girls are just as capable of scientific thinking as boys

6469,this@ chapter is an account@ of the way@ they perceived@ attempts to develop integrated provision for under@ fives and the barriers@ in@ attitudes@ and systems@ which were encountered@ 
6470,the first section@ provides@ an overview of provision and services in@ #

6472,the third section@ looks@ at@ the faltering progress towards@ integrated services
6473,the fourth section@ examines@ the formidable@ barriers@ that were posed by reorganisation of social services local authority cuts@ and the demise@ of the inner london education authority
6474,the chapter concludes@ with@ a mixture@ of resignation and determination
6475,background@ under-@ services in islington #
6476,islington is a multi-ethnic inner city london borough with@ a child population of #
6477,in@ # # per cent of under@ fives in islington had@ the use of an under@ facility # per cent on@ a full-time and # per cent on@ a part-time basis
6478,between@ # and # provision gradually increased so that by@ # there were # children's day centres about@ # playgroups and # assisted child-minding places funded partially or totally by the social services department and # full-time and # part-time places in nursery schools funded by the inner london education authority
6479,the beacon nursery a local mencap project offered@ care five days per week to children over@ one year of age categorised as having@ severe learning difficulties
6480,unlike council day centres playgroups or community nurseries the beacon nursery was free@ 
6481,children were collected from home by special bus and places were available on@ demand
6482,the beacon had been in@ existence for many years and in@ the past had catered for up to@ thirty children with@ a wide@ range@ of disabilities and needs
6483,by@ # it had@ half@ that@ number on@ roll@ 
6484,since # numbers at the beacon continued to fall@ as it was increasingly seen@ as a resource@ for children with@ severe and multiple disabilities
6485,in addition the elfreda rathbone organisation a voluntary organisation helping people with@ learning disabilities ran@ a free@ day nursery in the borough for a small@ number of children with@ learning difficulties
6486,some integrated services emerged@ in@ the early # one playscheme was developed through@ a parent's initiative and an integrated adventure playground was established bya voluntary organisation
6487,workers from the integrated playscheme subsequently supported@ a local special school in@ integrating under@ fives into@ a playgroup
6488,in addition to its mainstream schools the borough included five special schools providing primary and secondary education to children with@ special needs from islington and neighbouring boroughs one for children with@ moderate learning difficulties one for children with@ severe learning difficulties one for children with@ emotional and behavioural difficulties one for autistic children and one for children with@ physical disabilities
6489,in@ # three of these@ offered nursery places to children from@ the age of #
6490,the children usingall of these@ services came from a wide@ range@ of ethnic backgrounds@ though rarely was this@ actively and positively reflected@ in@ the type of care provided or the ethnic background@ of their carers
6491,residential units
6492,by@ # residential services were designed@ with@ care in@ the community in@ mind but most were based in@ specialist settings
6493,for example field end house had been open for three years as a specialist unit for children with@ learning difficulties and was designed@ to offer respite round the clock care
6494,parents had fought@ for this@ as a local resource@ to prevent the need for children to be placed in long-stay placements far from home
6495,by@ # field end had been joined by another specialist children's respite care unit at leigh road
6496,the social services department also provided thirteen short-term and long-term residential units for children in@ care by@ # their number had been reduced@ to@ eleven none with wheelchair access and only one with@ any experience of caring for children with@ learning difficulties
6497,the community health team
6498,the community health team had@ major responsibility for assessing children and recommending provision
6499,it included physiotherapists occupational and speech therapists doctors psychologists and a specialist health visitor
6500,they were joined in@ the network@ by specialist teachers funded by the ilea and based in the special schools who visited children at home before they were due to start school
6501,this@ group of people met on@ a regular basis to coordinate@ services and discuss professional issues
6502,discussion of services to individual children also took@ place@ 
6503,this@ included deciding between@ day care or school and parents' attitudes@ to@ different options
6504,often a member@ of the group was delegated to advise parents on@ a course@ of action
6505,the community health team aim@ was to ensure a place of treatment for children from@ the earliest possible age to enable them to develop to@ their fullest@ potential
6506,they were however an all-white group operating@ without@ directly involving parents and were generally committed to@ care in@ the community
6507,they gave@ support@ to@ the beacon and elfreda rathbone nurseries and most members saw@ these@ settings as the best places to treat children
6508,because of their early contact@ with parents they often had@ considerable influence in@ steering@ parents towards@ specialist provision
6509,the special services team
6510,in@ the early # social workers were funded jointly by the ilea and islington social services department to work with children attending two special schools and two specialist units for partially hearing children
6511,these@ social workers were based in@ the borough's special services team
6512,they all worked with some under@ fives attending the schools they covered@ 
6513,they were aware of a number of pre-school children who did not have@ adequate access@ to@ resources@ or support@ when parents and professionals were becoming aware of the possible extent and implications of the disability
6514,when a vacancy arose@ within@ this@ group of social workers in@ # it was decided to appoint someone specialising in@ work with under@ fives with@ special needs
6515,this@ might have had@ the effect of drawing@ families into@ the specialist system@ at@ an earlier stage@ 
6516,instead for a number of reasons it proved to be a key step@ in@ the development of the debate about@ integration in islington
6517,first the post was not attached@ to@ any specialist institution
6518,there was an expectation but not a contractual obligation that the postholder would work closely@ with the beacon nursery
6519,second the worker had@ an alternative peer group of under@ workers who were key figuresin@ controlling@ access@ to@ all other under-@ facilities
6520,third the worker was committed to@ the idea that treatmentof a medical or disabling condition should not take@ precedence over@ the child's social emotional and cultural needs
6521,there was now a new worker in@ the network@ who also made@ an early relationship with families but who could present a broader@ choice of day care to@ parents
6522,attempting an integration policy
6523,the labour council elected in@ # had@ as a stated policy aim@ that every child whose parents so wished was entitled to@ a pre-school place of some sort
6524,this@ led@ to@ the initiation of an under-@ review
6525,the review team set@ up@ under@ the auspices of the social services committee included councillors senior departmental management and representatives of the children's day centre organisers and under@ social workers in@ its membership
6526,it proposed a network@ of under-@ centres throughout the borough an idea which the under-@ workers had been anxious to promote for some time
6527,day care in each area would be organised and coordinated@ through@ the children's day centres which would also provide information support@ and resources@ to@ parents
6528,the review had made@ no mention of children with@ special needs
6529,the specialist social worker and another under-@ worker with@ a personal interest in@ the issues undertook a supplementary review to examine resources@ for these@ children
6530,they interviewed parents specialist professionals and mainstream day-care workers and they designed@ a questionnaire which was completed by workers in@ a large proportion of mainstream council services and voluntary organisations as well as by some child-minders
6531,broadly the survey confirmed@ that parents of children with@ special needs had not been given@ a real choice of placement and that they had to fight@ hard@ for mainstream provision if this@ was their choice
6532,parents wanted to be part@ of the decision-making and did not feel@ that they were
6533,many commented on@ lack of information about@ the range@ of facilities on@ offer
6534,one afro-caribbean woman describedhow she felt@ that she was never given@ a choice of provision for her son and objected to@ being told he should be in a specialist nursery for his own good
6535,she fought@ hard@ to get@ him a part-time playgroup place in@ the group his older brother attended
6536,because the group had known her and her children for some time they agreed to have@ a go@ and the placement went@ ahead@ 
6537,she commented
6538,i had to fight@ every step@ of the way@ for this@ 
6539,no one told me about@ it and no one wanted him to have@ it
6540,i knew it was right for him this@ is where he learnt to join in and be like other children
6541,it doesn't matter that he's not like them
6542,i know what is right for my child but i'm not supposed to say
6543,parents also wanted an increased availability of specialist therapy time but wanted it to be usedin@ a more flexible@ way@ 
6544,some parents were very worried@ that more integrated settings would lead@ to@ lack of attention for children with@ special needs
6545,definitions of special needs varied widely@ in@ the questionnaire responses some defining it as children with@ disabilities some including children with@ behavioural and emotional problems and some including children whose first language was not english
6546,this@ made@ the survey difficult to interpret
6547,the findings were documented in@ a report ccuf # and an analysis was prepared of the practical and bureaucratic problems in@ gaining an ordinary childcare place for a child with@ special needs with@ suggestions for how these@ might be overcome
6548,these@ ideas were informed@ bya paper which had already been produced@ by an active member@ of the local mencap group who had previously tried to generate@ the debate within@ the community health service through@ the mencap committee 
6549,the conference a place for all our children'
6550,as a result of this@ work the coordinating committee for under@ fives ccuf an umbrella organisation of statutory and voluntary sector groups and individuals providing a service to@ under@ fives decided to organise a conference to look@ at@ the issues of integration of special needs children within@ mainstream provision
6551,prior to the conference various groups met to produce@ short contributions to@ the debate
6552,these@ included parents under-@ workers specialist workers children's day centre organisers and playgroups organisers
6553,each of these@ groups came@ up@ with@ a list of proposals which were sent to everyone attending
6554,about@ # people attended the conference held@ in@ april #
6555,workshops facilitated by the speakers and the conference organising group examined integration policies overcoming practical problems for children in@ integrated provision and available sources@ of information
6556,the conference made@ the following recommendations
6557,#
6558,for a formal universal information system@ covering@ local and specialist resources@ 
6559,#
6560,for children's needs to be considered@ with parents and their wishes acknowledged and recognised

6579,over@ against@ the german army or the vichy government where@ social generality ruled@ as it does in@ all machines@ of state the resistance offered@ the rare phenomenon of historical action which remained personal
6580,the psychological and moral elements@ of political action were almost the only ones to appear@ here@ which is why intellectuals least inclined@ to@ politics were to be seen@ in@ the resistance
6581,the resistancewas a unique experience for them and they wanted to preserve@ its experience in@ the new french politics because this@ experience broke@ away from@ the famous dilemma of being and doing which confronts@ all intellectuals in@ the face@ of action
6582,it is only too obvious that this@ balance@ between@ action and personal life was intimately@ bound@ up@ with@ the conditions of clandestine action and could not survive@ it
6583,and in@ this@ sense@ it must be said@ that the resistance experience by making@ us believe that politics is a relationship@ between@ man and man or between@ consciousnesses fostered@ our illusions of # and masked@ the truth of the incredible power@ of history which the occupation taught@ us in@ another connection@ 
6584,if by@ # merleau-ponty had here@ already indicated@ the historical basis for what was to become sartre's project in@ the the theoretical problem that followed@ was how to unite@ orthodox marxist concepts of economic determinism and historical necessity with@ the individualism of sartre's earlier work that@ is the existentialist notion of the authentic self and the possibility of choosing one's own freedom how to relocate@ human practice within@ historical determinism to reconcile@ the individual with@ the social the idea of agency with@ that@ of necessity or freedom with@ history
6585,for marxist or hegelian thought such an age-old contradiction ought to be resolvable through@ the operations of dialectical logic
6586,citing marx's famous remark in@ men make@ their own history but under@ circumstances given@ and transmitted@ from@ the past sartre suggested that this@ implied the permanent and dialectical unity of freedom and necessity i #
6587,accordingly he attempted to shift@ marxism away from@ orthodox theories of an absolute determinism towards@ the primacy of a concept of history which while still a totality as it had been for lukcs a process with@ a determinate meaning and end@ could also include@ a concept of human agency and thus articulate@ the individual with@ the social freedom with@ determinism
6588,today sartre's voluntarism is to@ some extent@ returning@ to@ favour as the result of a desire to retrieve@ the categories of agency and the subject@ which goes@ together@ with@ the wish to get@ out of@ the apparently totalizing systems@ of adorno althusser or foucault
6589,sartre's stress@ on@ the role@ of the subject@ also finds@ approval because many of those@ no longer prepared@ to argue for a general theory of history as the progress@ of a single narrative@ of class-struggle@ have begun to argue instead for a return@ of its correlative the subject@ almost as if it was the next@ best thing@ in@ the absence of history itself
6590,but it still leaves@ us with@ the crucial problem that sartre had to solve namely how to link@ human consciousness with@ the processes of history so that the former can be said to be the agent@ of the latter
6591,how could this@ take@ place
6592,as sartre had put@ it in@ 
6593,never has better understood that he has history and never has he felt@ so powerless before@ history
6594,how can man make@ history if at@ the same time it is history which makes@ him
6595,sartre considered@ that orthodox dialectical materialism takes@ the easy way@ out@ bymerely eliminating@ the first in favour of the second making@ man a passive@ product@ entirely determined byeconomic circumstances
6596,unwilling to follow@ merleau-ponty bydropping@ the second in favour of the first sartre argued that it was possible for man to be both at once through@ the movement@ of that@ is intentional actions which produce@ material@ effects
6597,its corollary whereby praxis becomes determining history he called the practico-inert@ bywhich he meant the material circumstances that have themselves been createdbyprevious praxes and which form the conditions for new praxis
6598,the individual is thus both totalizer and totalized deftly@ uniting@ freedom with@ necessity
6599,though this@ neatly@ solves@ the problem of how man can make@ history while at@ the same time history makes@ him it does not answer@ the larger@ question of how a multiplicity of the products@ of individual acts totalizations can themselves be totalized into@ the overall totalization required bythe logic of dialectical rationality rather than being the arbitrary blind@ and self-cancelling movements@ of say@ hardy's immanent will
6600,sartre's fundamental thesis that history continually effects totalisations of totalisations i # does not in@ itself answer@ what ronald aronson has rightly characterized as question for sartre how do separate@ antagonistic@ actions yield@ history how do individual totalizations lead@ to@ totalization and also progress@ the direction@ of history its truth and its meaning
6601,for the whole@ basis of sartre's argument is that the dialectic of history is not a metaphysical law@ some powerful@ unitary force@ revealing@ itself behind@ history like the will of god but the continuously@ produced@ effect of individual conflicts each action is in@ its turn@ subsumed as a part@ of the wholein@ an ever broader@ developing totalization i #
6602,what sartre needs to demonstrate therefore is that if the law@ of the dialectic works@ from@ the individual level@ overall it produces@ nothing less than the intelligibility or the meaning of history as such
6603,the dialectic is the law@ of totalization which createscollectivities societies and history realities that is which impose@ themselves on@ individuals but at@ the same time it must be woven@ out of@ millions of individual actions
6604,we must show@ that it is possible for it to be both a and a how it can continually bring about the unity of dispersive profusion and integration
6605,i #
6606,but what produces@ the overall direction@ of history
6607,how does it continually bring about the unity of dispersive profusion and integration
6608,sartre does not attempt to answer this@ question shifting@ rather to@ the notion of a lack of self-consciousness
6609,the dialectic is the law@ that remains hidden@ 
6610,at@ the moment history is made@ without@ being known history constitutes we might say today a political@ unconscious@ 
6611,marxism on@ the other hand@ sartre claims is history itself becoming conscious@ of itself i # as for lukcs it is bybecoming conscious@ of itself as the subject@ of history that the working class will understand@ history's meaning and so recognize@ itself as the meaning of history
6612,while he suggests@ in@ apocalyptic tones@ in@ that this@ process of self-consciousness is at last beginning to take@ place and that civil foreign and colonial wars are becoming apparent as different forms@ of a single class struggle@ sartre also admits@ that the divorce@ between@ theory and praxis which ensued under@ stalinism has generally prevented any clear@ self-consciousness among@ the masses@ 
6613,the detour@ of stalinism is thus formalized as marxism's own descent@ into@ its unconscious@ resulting in@ a dream-work@ of heterogeneous histories that have eluded@ systematization and subsumption into@ the single meaning of marxism's own reading@ of history
6614,it is therefore sartre argues our historical task to make@ it known promoting not just the historical process as such but also the general recognition@ whereby the plurality of the meanings of individual histories can be seen@ to combine@ to make@ one history with@ one meaning the truth of humanity i #
6615,sartre's account@ thus sets@ up@ the articulation@ of history univocal meaning and totality as the indissoluble set of elements@ required for the validation of marxism necessary in order to save@ it from@ its detour@ from@ itself
6616,the problem however remains@ how such universals are produced@ from@ the multiplicity of initiating@ individual praxes
6617,if history is a history of conflict how could it be both one and internally@ diversified without@ the inner@ moving@ principle of the dialectic
6618,how can history be a unity if it is also conflictual if each action is aimed@ at@ destroying@ the other and results in@ a double@ negation@ in@ which the original aims@ of each action have been destroyed@ bythe other
6619,if each action negates the aim@ of the other where is the unity totalized in@ the conflict
6620,how does history constantly totalize itself
6621,i # # sartre arrives@ at@ what he calls the real problem of history that@ is how there can be totalization without@ a totalizer only at@ the very end@ of volume i it is not until@ the next@ volume however that he intends to show@ how individual actions separate multiplicities make@ up@ human history with@ truth and intelligibility i #
6622,throughout@ sartre has nevertheless taken@ it for granted that such a totalisation is constantly developing both as history and as historical truth i #
6623,his history therefore is always in@ process but its teleology of a final totalization always has to be assumed@ 
6624,he thus asserts the truth of history while constantly projecting@ forwards@ and deferring its proof
6625,but when the proof comes@ it also turns@ out@ to rest@ on@ the assumption that it is already true@ 
6626,iii the second 
6627,we are trying to establishthe 
6628,sartre produces@ a persuasive@ formulation@ of the relation@ of the individual to@ the determining historical circumstance through@ his concepts of praxis and the practico-inert@ it is also obvious to@ him how the larger@ question of history ought to be solved
6629,he asserts it often enough history continually effects totalisations of totalisations i #
6630,but in@ volume i of the as we have seen@ he continually defers the demonstration@ of his proof
6631,for the dogmatic dialectic as he describes dialectical materialism the whole@ question naturally@ poses no problem for each person or group simply constitutes a partial moment of an already operative@ movement@ of totalization that produces@ them and then goes@ beyond@ them
6632,but sartre's dispensing@ with@ all historicist schemas@ createsthe problem of how between@ two autonomous and contradictory totalizations there could be one dialectical intelligibility of the ongoing process ii #
6633,he attempts to solve this@ through@ matching@ his account@ of contradiction with@ a new concept derived@ from@ the conjunction of work and labour anti-labour a category of negation@ 
6634,the products@ of a conflict as well as its residues@ may seem incomprehensible insofar as they differ from@ the original intentions of any of the combatants@ 
6635,nevertheless they constitute the basis and conditions for further actions and history
6636,dialectical reason encounters@ such products@ as undecidables 
6637, because they seem to be at once the results of a communal enterprise while at@ the same time bearing@ witness@ to@ the fact that this@ enterprise never existed except as the inhuman reverse side@ of two opposed actions in@ which each aims@ to destroy@ the other
6638,in@ the dialectical perspective@ we encounter@ these@ objects@ as productions which are human and provided with@ a future thus they seem bythemselves to be totalizations in@ process
6639,ii #
6640,this@ means@ that first they lead@ to@ results and second that the internal@ structure@ of social objects@ contains@ the double negation@ of themselves and of each constituent part@ bythe other ii #
6641,there is therefore before@ any understanding of historic agents@ and movements@ a certain in@ all social ensembles@ from@ afar@ they may appear@ whole@ but close@ to@ they can be seen@ as riddled@ with@ holes@ 
6642,this@ increasingly comes@ to resemble nothing so much as sartre's own account@ of history
6643,in@ the context@ of the negativity of this@ formulation@ sartre is obliged to pose once again the problem of whether there can be a totalization without@ any independent totalizer or totalizing force@ such as the dialectic or whether the structure@ of negation@ that he has describedmeans@ that as for adorno or bakhtin history does not develop positively but rather negatively and is therefore instead detotalizing
6644,marxism is rigorously true@ if history is totalization it is not so any more if human history decomposes@ into@ a plurality of particular histories or if in@ any case within@ the relationship@ of immanence that characterizes struggle@ the negation@ of each adversary@ bythe other is on@ principle 
6645,certainly we have@ neither the design@ nor the actual possibility of showing@ here@ the full@ truth of dialectical materialism
6646,our goal@ is solely to establishwhether in@ a practical ensemble@ torn@ apart@ byantagonismwhether there are multiple conflicts or whether they are reduced@ to@ one the breaks@ themselves are totalizing and carried@ along@ bythe totalizing movement@ of the ensemble@ 
6647,ii #
6648,at@ this@ point@ sartre confronts@ the possibility that the whole@ project of the stated so confidently on@ its very first page it must be proved that a negation@ of a negation@ can be an affirmation@ i # may break@ down@ 
6649,perhaps the truth of history cannot be proved its direction@ cannot be discerned@ 
6650,sartre's reaction@ to@ the threat@ that the negation@ of a negation@ may produce@ a detotalizing effect is to introduce@ a new category a unifying force@ of a singularization which incarnates@ the universal if totalization really is an ongoing process he writes then it operates@ everywhere
6651,that@ means both that there is a dialectical meaning of the practical ensemble@ and that each singular event totalizes in@ itself the practical ensemble@ in@ the infinite richness@ of its singularity ii #
6652,unlike lukcs' insignificant event from@ which the universal is precariously drawn@ out@ through@ the narrative sartre's singularity works@ synecdochally in@ a conventional antinomy with@ the universal the relation@ between@ the two structured@ according to the familiar@ nineteenth-century model@ of organic@ growth@ or process in@ which each singular event makes@ up@ the wholewhile as he puts@ it the whole is entirely present in@ the part@ as its present@ meaning and as its destiny
6653,sartre's singular universal therefore begs@ the question for it is predicated on@ the assumption that if there is not a totality as such then there already is an overall totalization if totalization really is an ongoing process
6654,that@ developingprocess is itself totalized through@ sartre's assertion@ that each totalization is the totalization of all struggles@ as it must be if the singular is to incarnate@ the universal
6655,the concept of the singular universal thus facilitates a circularity in@ the argument whereby sartre can avoid@ the question which he began byposing
6656,so the singular universal presumes@ the totalization he can't yet prove
6657,this@ strategy@ marks@ a structure@ of repetition in@ sartre's text each time he poses the question of how there can be totalization of history without@ a totalizer he retreats@ to@ a more limited example whose unity is already evident but which in@ the end@ only brings@ him back@ to@ the original question again
6658,in@ this@ case sartre demonstrates@ how the singular universal works@ byappealing@ to@ the concrete@ example of a boxing match a random exemplification that just happens to reproduce@ the single adversaries@ of the master slave dialectic
6659,its totalization takes@ place through@ its incarnation@ as part@ of the totality of boxing in@ the overall framework@ within@ which each individual fight occurs
6660,each boxing match sartre claims must be both a unique event and also in@ some sense@ the incarnation@ of all boxing whose rules@ and conventions it follows@ and whose past and future history it sets@ itself against@ 
6661,but it is also apparent that that@ totality is not completely known nor is its future shape@ even presumed
6662,bytotalization therefore sartre does not here@ mean anything like a predetermined end@ or final closure@ of a totality but rather a process of mediation@ among@ the parts@ where@ each is determined by the other
6663,no one can predict the future of boxing either at@ the level@ of particular victories@ or defeats@ in@ effect a structure@ of repetition nor at@ the more general level@ of possible modifications or developmentsof the sport
6664,yet each individual bout articulates@ itself within@ the framework@ of the history of boxing known and unknown
6665,this@ allows@ sartre to include@ chance and contingency in@ his scheme
6666,since it cannot be known as a concept that will realize@ itself in@ the future sartre argues instead that the totality only produces@ itself in@ the moment the incarnation@ as such is at@ once unrealizable except as totalization of everything and irreducible to@ a pure@ abstract unity of that@ which it totalizes ii #
6667,the universal the totality can only be known through@ the singular
6668,but its future direction@ remains unknown and indeterminate
6669,at@ the same time sartre makes@ a larger@ though less persuasive claim that the boxing-match also works@ synecdochally and re-exteriorizes a more fundamental violence namely the interiorized condition of scarcity that he considers@ to be the basis of conflict in general
6670,the boxing match is the public incarnation@ of conflict ii # totalizing in@ its own struggle@ the wholeof contemporary irreducibilities and fissures@ ii #
6671,thus one can and must say that each fight is the singularisation of all of the social whole in@ movement@ and that bythis@ singularisation it incarnates@ the enveloping@ totalization which the historical process is
6672,ii #
6673,but then he adds i have said and i repeat that we have not yet proved that this@ enveloping@ totalization exists
6674,so although it is possible to conceive@ of any event as an incarnation@ of the totality insofar as it must itself make@ up@ a part@ of that@ totality in@ its determination unlike the case of the boxing match where@ we can define@ the overall entity boxing it still remains unproven that an overall entity history can be said to exist at all
6675,for all his use of the model@ of the boxing match sartre has really got@ no further@ with@ the fundamental question of how there can be totalization without@ a totalizer
6676,it is simple enough for him to show@ that a boxing match takes@ place within@ a general totality of boxing which is itself only ever present in@ any individual incarnation@ for as a game each match is both an individual bout and something conducted@ according to general rules@ and a specific social tradition
6677,but what about@ those@ conflicts that do not take@ place within@ such a constituted social system@ such as conflictual bourgeois societies which cannot be said to be unified except as sartre suggests@ dismissively byappeal@ to@ a lost@ paradise@ before@ the class struggle@ 
6678,such societies make@ the conflicts of history irreducible to@ sartre's logic unless like the boxing match they can be shown@ to take@ part@ in@ a larger@ totalizable category
6679,however when he poses the question of whether his method could work@ as well for the class struggle@ as for the boxing match sartre admits@ that he finds@ it impossible to answer and returns@ instead to@ the much easier case of sub-groups
6680,once again he backtracks@ and assumes@ a larger@ unity in@ which conflict takes@ place 
6681,the major question thus always remains unanswered in@ the every time that sartre announces@ that he is about@ to proceed@ with@ the fundamental problem of how history can be a totalization without@ a totalizer he turns@ back@ to@ a previous more easily intelligible stage@ on@ the way@ 
6682,his difficulty is accompanied@ bya no doubt symptomatic@ increasing distrust of universals so that in@ championing specificities against@ them he seems to give up the attempt to validate the universals history as totalization that originally formed@ the object@ of his project
6683,at@ this@ point@ a further contradiction in@ sartre's whole@ enterprise begins to open@ up@ for someone so deeply@ distrustful of universals it seems curious that he has involved himself so emphatically with@ the notions of totality history and the dialectic
6684,as sartre insists more and more upon@ the virtues@ of specificity ii # # such is his distaste for marxist or any other universalizing categories that he refuses even to countenance them attempting to replace@ concepts with@ specificities universals with@ singulars
6685,his scepticism goes@ to@ the extent@ of even denying the existence of society or the nation as such ii # # the very totalities which his own general argument for totalization requires
6686,here@ certain similarities with@ later post-marxist theorists such as foucault or lyotard begin to become apparent
6687,but if sartre anticipates such later thinkers we should not assume@ too quickly@ that they have simply taken@ his insights further@ 
6688,for sartre's singular universal could never be expectedto solve the formal@ theoretical problem of how individual existential existence can be related to@ history insofar as it simply renames in@ one oxymoronic category the original antithetical terms
6689,without@ an adequate theory of their articulation@ they simply begin to separate@ again

6707,besides away from their home base knights were useless on@ their own
6708,in@ open@ battle and in@ the plundering expeditions that constituted the normal form@ of aggressive warfare they needed the backing@ of archers both mounted and on@ foot and of numerous infantrymen

6741,when raymond of toulouse robert ii of flanders robert curthose stephen of blois and hugh of vermandois responded@ to@ the call@ past and present members@ of their military households@ fell@ almost automatically@ into@ rank behind@ them to test themselves against@ terrible dangers but also to enjoy the companionship in@ arms the adventure the deeds of daring which were the stuff@ of the 
6742,that they shared@ along with all other participants in@ the crusade a fervent devotion a conviction@ that their sins would be forgiven is certain
6743,yet for them crusading necessitated no large@ leap@ of the imagination no millenarian vision@ it was simply a challenging and a deserving extension@ of their everyday activities
6744,in@ french eyes@ the hero of the first crusade was robert ii of flanders
6745,while raymond of toulouse remained in outremer stephen and hugh disgraced themselves in@ escaping from@ the siege of antioch and robert curthose no matter how gallant at least in@ his lifetime failed to impress@ robert ii's prestige soared@ to@ the skies@ 
6746,he became robert of jerusalem to@ his contemporaries his deeds were recorded in@ the his pious bravery totally expunged@ the memory of robert the frisian's usurpation and after@ his death his son baldwin vii harped@ on@ his father's achievement to justify his substantial useof coercion against@ the enemies of the church
6747,outside flanders robert's sister's marriage to@ roger of sicily was a mark@ of his new position@ in@ the world like louis vi's sister's marriage to@ bohemond of antioch it stretched@ french kinship connections@ into the new norman colonies ensuring that travellers from the homeland would find@ a welcome in those distant parts
6748,robert's example was a potent one
6749,after@ the next change@ in@ dynasty thierry and philip of alsace strengthened@ their shaky@ claim to@ the comital position@ byattaining for themselves the prestige attached@ to@ being the outstanding crusaders of their generation
6750,thierry's remote@ connection@ with@ the family of godfrey de bouillon along with his marriage with@ sybilla of anjou fulk v's daughter gave@ him some claim to@ the throne of jerusalem as a consequence the aristocracy of outremer viewed@ him and philip with@ mixed@ feelings@ expecting much of them yet fearing their ambitions
6751,in@ the end it was not in outremer but in the newly conquered byzantine empire that the flemish crusading achievement was crowned@ with@ the elevation@ of count baldwin ix to@ the imperial throne in@ #
6752,but in@ the twelfth century the house of alsace could afford the high@ costs of their expeditions thierry went to jerusalem four times philip twice and the counts' repeated absences in@ fact promoted@ administrative reform the and the were as much the products@ of crusading as the english and norman judicial system@ and exchequers were the product@ of the king-duke's divided@ attentions
6753,but if on@ balance@ the flemish counts benefited materially from@ crusading as arguably did the angevin they were far from typical
6754,for other french houses a commitment to@ outremer often represented a sacrifice@ of domestic political interest
6755,the achievements of raymond iv st gilles in@ consolidating his authority within toulouse were threatened@ byhis departure in@ # especially since it was known that he had@ no intention of returning home
6756,then his example lured@ his elder son bertrand to tripoli in@ # and his younger son alphonse jourdain there in@ #
6757,had not his grandson raymond v fulfilled his crusading obligation in@ his early youth thereby freeing@ himself from@ the necessity@ of interrupting his career in the county the principality of toulouse might have disintegrated@ altogether
6758,william ix's crusade of # brought about serious@ financial problems in aquitaine which caused rapid devaluation in@ the hitherto stable@ currency and robert curthose's decision to mortgage normandy to@ william rufus in order to cover@ his crusading expenses exacerbated a conflict over@ the duchy which was not settled@ until@ the death of his son william clito in #
6759,all in@ all it was not surprising that suger mulling over the precedents of early crusading tried@ to dissuade louis vii from@ embarking@ on@ his jerusalem journey in@ #
6760,yet the appeal@ of crusading was if anything even stronger@ to@ those aristocratic houses just below@ the level@ of the princely it was after@ all the house of boulogne which produced@ the first two rulers of jerusalem
6761,the counts of nevers the lords of montpellier the lords of amboise and lusignan the trencavels were fervent devotees of the ideal so the problems of absences shipwrecks death abroad plagued them as much as their princes
6762,on@ occasion their determination@ to sacrifice@ for christ played@ directly@ into@ their overlord's hands@ as when the count of la marche who had@ no direct@ heir sold his county to@ king henry ii in #
6763,when it did not accompanying their princes in@ a joint crusading venture as the lord of amboise accompanied fulk v or hugh vi de lusignan william ix created new personal links@ 
6764,the political spin-offs@ from@ crusading are therefore more difficult to calculate@ than at@ first glance@ they might appear@ 
6765,nevertheless it is clear@ that the chief@ gainer was louis vii
6766,the irony of this@ lay@ in@ the fact that the second crusade was counter-productive in outremer embittered relations with@ byzantium and resulted in@ the deaths of enormous@ numbers of its participants particularly those@ drawn@ from@ the nonaristocratic classes
6767,yet it consolidated the king's position@ within france partly through@ the skilled regency of suger but also because in@ taking on@ himself the leadership of the expedition louis re-emerged@ as a credible ruler of men
6768,his noble gesture@ appeased those churchmen who had been appalled by his early obstinacy over@ the archbishopric of bourges
6769,the disasters that befell his army paradoxically heightened his personal charisma even the barons of outremer continued to look@ on@ him as their one potential saviour
6770,his friendship with@ raymond v of toulouse a fellow warrior reversed@ the trend of history since the middle@ of the tenth century in@ bringing@ the princes of the far south back@ into@ the king's 
6771,the crowds of burgundians who accompanied the king learned to respect him on@ their return they sought the arbitration of the royal court in@ their disputes and they welcomed louis's intervention within the counties that fringed the duchy of burgundy
6772,as william of st denis put@ it 
6773,even as early as # it was apparent that the crusading movement@ had provided a new sense@ of aristocratic cohesion in the realm
6774,the great joint expeditions the combined leaderships although not without@ friction@ had been justified bytheir outstanding achievement the conquest and maintenance of jerusalem
6775,they were the the deeds of the franks or the god's deeds performed through@ the franks as two of their earliest chroniclers entitled them
6776,but what was missing@ before@ # was a clear@ sense@ of who the franks were
6777,the second crusade however was launched@ with@ st bernard's ringing@ appeal to@ the count and barons of brittany 
6778,in@ taking@ his place at the head@ of the second crusade the decisively hastened the transformation of the franks into@ the french
6779,#
6780,the philosopher's child
6781,judith hughes
6782,some of our children are missing@ 
6783,children have served@ philosophy very well
6784,that@ is the first thing@ which anyone surveying@ the literature would notice
6785,along with a selection from@ a list including women animals madmen foreigners slaves patients and imbeciles children have served@ in@ that@ great@ class of beings the not-men in@ contrast@ with@ which male philosophers have defined@ and valued@ themselves
6786,unlike the others who appear@ and disappear@ as fashion@ and progress@ dictate@ children occupy@ a permanent place@ in@ the list partly because of their continuing presence@ as a potential sub@ partly because they have never protested and mainly because it is assumedthat in@ favourable circumstances they will become men and therefore require attention
6787,they have receivedit in@ the shape@ of detailed educational theory carefully worked out to see@ them through@ the maturation process from@ infancy to@ adulthood
6788,generations of philosophers have documented this@ process
6789,perhaps the best known versionis shakespeare's seven ages of man which is a poetic statement of what had already been received wisdom for centuries and was to remain so for centuries to come@ 
6790,education was to guide@ the infant through@ the transition to@ manhood including such stages@ as childhood boyhood and youth
6791,that@ is the second thing@ to notice the philosopher's children are boys
6792,the fact that at least half of the world's children would not actually go@ through@ this@ process beyond@ the first two stages@ is conveniently forgotten or ignored and no doubt the reasons for this@ were largely social
6793,but the neglect of girl children through@ the centuries of theorising is more than a social injustice though many might think this@ real and bad enough
6794,education has@ an end@ 
6795,although it is fashionable to talk about@ its value@ for its own sake what prompts@ the theorising is the strong@ and well-founded belief that the experiences of childhood affect the kind of adult which the child turns@ out@ to be
6796,where@ the end@ is personrather than role@ that is where@ the end@ is the developmentof the human mind and spirit rather than the production@ of say information technologists then education is valued@ in relation to some conception@ of worthwhile human existence which it is meant to serve@ 
6797,such an ideal does not stand@ isolated@ from@ the practices which strive@ towards@ it but interacts@ with@ those@ practices helps@ to construct@ them and is in@ turn@ constructed@ by them
6798,the great@ philosophers have always produced@ such a person-oriented account@ at least for those@ whose education was thought to matter
6799,education has been directed@ at@ the production@ of the rational the free@ the independent of mind the dignified in short the autonomous@ human being
6800,yet because the philosopher's adult has traditionally been male his children boy children and his educational programmes designed@ to facilitate the transition between@ them the ideal of the fully human person has been masculinised to@ the point@ where@ otherwise thoughtful and sometimes good and wise men have unashamedly admitted@ that this@ defining@ ideal is not applicable to@ half the species
6801,rationality turns into@ narrow@ intellectualism freedom@ into@ licence independence into@ isolationism dignity into@ selfish pride the autonomous@ human being turns@ out@ to be no more than a social atom@ after@ all
6802,the degeneration occurs@ not because men are congenitally@ or even incorrigibly narrow@ libertine isolated@ or selfish but because in@ defining@ themselves as autonomous@ beings in@ opposition to@ other human beings they have had to seek what separates@ them as a group@ from@ others
6803,it is a curiously@ paradoxical foundation@ uponupon@ which to build@ a theory of autonomy@ 
6804,moral autonomy@ is concerned@ with@ individuals not with@ groups@ a conception@ of autonomy@ which depends upon@ group@ membership displays@ its own contradiction
6805,this@ paper is partly about@ the rejection of certain accounts@ of autonomy@ though not with@ the rejection of the ideal of autonomy@ itself
6806,it is also about@ children
6807,women philosophers and girl children
6808,why should women in general and women philosophers in particular be specially interested in@ the nature@ and status of children
6809,there are of course the familiar and obvious reasons connected@ with@ women's traditional role@ in@ child-rearing but there are less obvious reasons too
6810,when philosophers dismiss@ women as not-men they frequently do more than simply lump them together@ with@ children or lunatics
6811,explicitly or implicitly the suggestion is that women children or lunatics or whichever other company@ they keep@ 
6812,it would be well to know just what this@ entails@ 
6813,schopenhauer said@ that women remainbig children alltheir lives it would be interesting to know what he thought children were like
6814,a common result of this@ is that when the philosophers deny autonomy@ to@ women they do so for the same sorts of reason that they deny it@ to@ children and cite lack of rationality capriciousness and vulnerability among@ their characteristics
6815,we can do more than to reject such descriptions of ourselves we can ask further questions are children like this@ is this@ why children are not autonomous@ 
6816,again women well know what it is like to be treatedas children and they find@ it offensive@ 
6817,it would therefore be reasonable to consider@ whether children find@ it offensive@ to be treatedlike children
6818,is being treatedas a child an intrinsically humiliating and self-denying experience
6819,what is it to be treatedas a child
6820,women philosophers are in@ a special position@ to consider@ such questionsfor in@ the image@ of the philosopher's child they see@ themselves
6821,it is no accident@ that the liberation@ of women such as it is should form@ part@ of a wider@ movement@ of liberation@ in general liberation@ for one part@ of the not-men is bound@ to have@ a knock-on effect when your fellow@ groups@ are sometimes quite literally identifiedwith@ you
6822,the assumption that all groups@ in@ the not-men class are identical with@ each other is so firmly@ rooted that as we shall see@ in@ the fourth section@ it is readily assumedeven by modern libertarian thinkers that showing@ that for example some ground@ for distinguishing@ between@ men and women is false@ or irrelevant immediately@ commits@ us to@ the view@ that the same ground@ is irrelevant in@ distinguishing@ men from@ children
6823,that@'s what they used to say@ about@ women is not a proof that saying@ it about@ a child is false@ 
6824,but it should make@ us very suspicious
6825,that when women are given@ the vote it follows@ that children should be given@ it too is no argument at all but a version of it occurs@ in@ modern debates over@ the justice or injustice of mill's famous disclaimer in@ his essay 
6826,having denied that we may ever legitimately interfere with@ the liberty@ of another except on@ the grounds@ of self-protection mill # asserts@ 
6827,this@ principle is meant to apply@ only to@ human beings in@ the maturityof their faculties
6828,we are not speaking@ of children or of young persons below@ the age which the law may fix@ as that@ of manhood or womanhood
6829,those@ who are still in@ a state to require being taken@ care of by others must be protected against@ their own actions as well as against@ external injury@ 
6830,p#
6831,this@ view@ as we shall see@ has been attacked@ on@ the grounds@ that it rests@ on@ the false@ assumption that the distinction between@ adults and children is identical with@ the distinction between@ rational and non-rational beings
6832,the attacks@ are based@ on@ empirical observation@ most women and older children are actually quite as rational as most men while some men are actually less rational
6833,if we agree that in@ that@ case women should be embraced@ bythe liberty@ principle then so should children
6834,i shall suggest that this@ does not follow@ because rationality is not in@ fact the grounds@ for the distinction in@ the first place@ 
6835,partly to redress the balance@ and partly because talking@ about@ children covers@ such a wide@ range@ of potential images@ i shall try to keep@ before@ my mind an ordinary #-year-old of our society
6836,she is the child of this@ paper unless i indicate@ otherwise
6837,throughout@ we should ask ourselves does whatever is being said@ apply@ to@ 
6838,first of all let us remind ourselves of the traditional picture@ of children drawn@ for us by some great@ philosophers of the past
6839,one thing@ they are all quite sure about@ is that children are not like adults in particular they agree that children lack some capacity@ for rational thought which adults have@ 
6840,now we are # or # or #
6841,the slave has@ absolutely no deliberative faculty the woman has@ but its authority@ is imperfect so has@ the child but in@ this@ case it is immature@ 
6842,aristotle #a
6843,children are not endued@ with@ reason at all tillthey have attained the use of speech but are called@ reasonable creatures for the possibility apparent of having@ the use of reason in@ time to come@ 
6844,hobbes # p #
6845,children love to be treatedas rational creatures sooner than is imagined by which
6846,i mean that you should make@ them sensible by the mildness@ of your carriage@ and the composureeven in@ your correction of them that what you do is reasonable in@ you and useful and necessary for them
6847,locke # p #
6848,in@ training@ for youth the child must be given@ reasons in@ the training@ of the infant for childhood this@ cannot be done
6849,young children ought merely to have@ things@ shown@ to@ them as they are or they get puzzled and ask question after@ question
6850,but as we approach@ the age of youth reason appears@ 
6851,at@ what age ought the education for youth to begin@ 
6852,roughly@ at@ the age of ten years when bynature@ the child enters@ the stage@ of youth and begins to reflect@ 
6853,the youth is capable of having@ principles his religious and moral ideas can be cultivated@ and he is able to attend to@ his own refinement@ 
6854,kant # pp ##
6855,if a society lets@ any considerable number of its members@ grow up mere children incapable of being acted on@ byrational consideration@ of distant@ motives societyhas itself to blame@ for the consequences
6856,mill # p #
6857,what are the philosophers' children like
6858,they have@ an immature@ deliberative faculty aristotle are not endued@ with@ reason hobbes until@ roughly@ the age of # kant and are incapable of being acted@ upon@ by rational consideration of distant@ motives mill
6859,but they are not completely lost@ causes@ 
6860,the immature@ deliberative faculty will mature@ children have@ the possibility apparent of turninginto@ rational beings hobbes they love to be reatedas though they were rational though they are not so yet locke you can give@ the prerational child reasons for acting in@ certain ways@ and he will turninto the youth who is capable of having@ principles kant
6861,until@ the time when these@ things@ happen then mill's disclaimer comes@ into@ operation
6862,children must be taken@ care of by others and protected from@ external injury@ and against@ their own actions 
6863,the traditional view@ is encapsulated@ in@ the claim that children are not autonomous@ that is on@ a standard interpretation they lack the capacity@ to act rationally in pursuit of@ their own self-chosen goals@ 
6864,it is then a matter of preference whether you say@ that they cannot choose the goals@ or that they cannot form@ strategies to achieve them or both
6865,in@ either case the political implication is that denying rights to@ children is entirely justified@ and there@ the matter rests@ 
6866,in@ all this@ there are perhaps a couple of things@ which look@ plausible when we compare the philosopher's child with@ our mental picture@ aristotle's observation@ that children are immature@ and mill's suggestion that they might need protection
6867,beyond@ that@ the similarities seem remote@ 
6868,there is obviously something wrong with@ a portrayal of children as totally lacking in@ reason until they leap out of bed on@ their tenth birthday announcing that they are now able to act on@ principle
6869,apart from being false such an account@ leaves@ no room@ in@ our thinking about@ children for things@ like teaching and learning or development in@ understanding and character and all those@ other concepts which refer@ to@ processes and not to states
6870,the tension@ between@ these@ theoretical views@ of children as non-rational non-autonomous@ beings and the practical knowledge of real children is evident in@ those@ quotations from@ hobbes and locke and kant and mill
6871,children according to hobbes have@ the possibility apparent of becoming reasonable
6872,in@ what does the possibility consist
6873,hobbes is not usingan inductive argument here@ the possibility apparent is not an inductive argument from@ observations@ about@ past@ children but is meant to refer@ to@ some discernible feature@ of present@ ones
6874,but what
6875,hobbes does not tell@ us but whatever it is it had better be something which a monkey does not have@ 
6876,it is not language since hobbes is here@ talking@ about@ the prelinguistic child
6877,perhaps it consists in@ the ability to respond@ intelligently to@ the language of others
6878,but then either hobbes has failed to distinguish@ the child from@ at least the higher@ and domesticated animals or the force@ of intelligently must be explained in@ such a way@ as to exclude@ animals
6879,in@ any case if such a qualification is called@ for@ it is hard@ to see@ how a creature with@ no rationality at all could possess@ it
6880,locke's remarks are just as puzzling
6881,children are definitely not rational but love to be treatedas if they were
6882,how is this@ possible
6883,apparently they like having@ things@ explained to@ them without@ understanding either the explanation or even what an explanation is
6884,perhaps he just means that they like the sound of my voice
6885,well maybe they do but making any old@ noises is clearlynot sufficient to enter@ the rationality stakes@ i must at least something
6886,is it just that i talk to@ them that they love
6887,maybe but i can also if i like talk to@ my car but yelling at@ it in@ the approved basil fawlty manner is hardly treatingit as rational
6888,lockean children have@ the added@ amazing ability to recognise@ reason in@ you without@ possessing@ any themselves while kantian kids two stages@ back@ from@ rationality have@ the disconcerting habit@ of getting puzzled and asking questions
6889,mill's minors are a little more complicated
6890,part@ of the time he sees@ them in@ the familiar way@ as creatures who lack rationality to@ at least some degree@ 
6891,but in@ the disclaimer his children need above@ all to be protected from@ the ghastly consequences of their own actions
6892,their problem seems to be not one of the inability to choose@ goals@ or to form@ strategies for achieving them but an incorrigible@ propensity to choose@ the wrong ones and an awesome efficiency in@ achieving them unless adults intervene
6893,all in@ all it is a pretty unconvincing picture@ 
6894,if you say@ that children are completely non-rational then you have to account for@ the fact that they become rational and to do that@ it appears from@ these@ examples that you have to assume that they already are
6895,if on@ the other hand@ you allow@ rationality to@ children then you cannot use their lack of it as a criterion to distinguish@ them from@ adults
6896,hobbes 
6897,are not aware of the unreality of their original pictures@ which is why often in@ the same sentence they produce@ these@ contradictions
6898,the one thing@ they do not do is to re-examine the original@ for the tell-tale signs@ of forgery@ 
6899,illegitimate inferences
6900,the recognition@ that children cannot simply be written@ off@ in@ the rationality stakes@ and cannot therefore be denied autonomy@ on@ this@ account@ has led@ some writers to conclude that they cannot therefore be denied it on@ any account@ 
6901,we should notice@ that this@ view@ is not just a flight@ of fancy from@ the loony left the pederast lobby or children themselves
6902,it is also to be found@ in@ stronger@ or weaker@ versions@ of more cautious academic thought
6903,in@ # john holt notes@ that children are in@ fact capable of a great deal more than modern society allows@ them to be
6904,he sees@ childhood as a fairly modern invention@ designed@ to fit@ adult rather than children's needs and an oppressive invention@ at@ that@ 
6905,he suggests that children should be given@ a comprehensive range@ of civil and legal rights including the right to vote to manage their own financial affairs to direct@ and manage their own education and to control@ their own sex lives and 
6906,to make@ and enter@ into@ on@ a basis of mutual consent quasifamilial relationships outside@ one's immediate@ family ie the right to seek and choose guardians other than one's own parents and to be legally dependent on@ them
6907,holt # p #
6908,this@ is also the view@ put forward by john harris though in@ less specific terms
6909,like holt harris believes that the so-called incompetence of children is an adult invention@ imposed on@ children for adults' convenience
6910,he makes@ a firm@ proposal that the age of majority should be gradually reduced@ to@ # years and remarks
6911,we must remember that to deny someone control@ of their own lives is to offer them a most profound insult not to mentionthe which the frustration of their wishes and the setting@ at@ naught@ of their own plans for themselves will add@ 
6912,perhaps we should conduct@ annual examinations from@ an early age to be sure that we do as littleof this@ sort of damage@ as possible
6913,harris # p #
6914,now holt and harris both have@ many wise@ enlightened@ and humane@ observations@ to make@ about@ some of the injustices which we inflict upon@ children but as these@ remarksshow@ putting@ them right without@ inflicting equally grave injustice is no easy matter
6915,both of them appear to suffer@ from@ a form@ of mental myopia@ in@ imagining the consequences of such proposals and i am not here@ referring@ only to@ mill-type consequences of harm brought about by unwise decisions
6916,what we may ask holt happens to@ the child who dissatisfied athome seeks in vain for guardians who would suit@ him
6917,what if no one wants him
6918,our papers are currently full@ of hard@ children in@ local authority care advertising for foster or adoptive parents
6919,in@ such a situation@ the skilled care of social workers is crucial to ensuring that an unwanted by-product@ of success for some children is not the total destruction@ of self-esteem for others
6920,what we may ask harris happens to@ the child who repeatedly fails his annual examination
6921,to impose such a test on@ children would be a particularly invidious way@ of discriminating against@ them unless harris has@ in@ mind that we should all undergo such examination
6922,he might then be open@ to bitter@ objections from@ many adults
6923,these@ two suggestions far@ from@ being enlightened liberation@ of all children are actually oppression of a deeply@ damaging@ kind to@ at least some and harris's suggestion contains@ a capacity@ criterion in@ disguise@ 
6924,in@ any case it would be dishonest to pretend that mill-type consequences are not relevant here@ 
6925,suppose holt's #-year-old does opt out of@ school
6926,what happens to@ her then
6927,what happens if her father is unwilling or unable to stay at home with her
6928,is it any better to oblige her to go abseiling or butterfly-catching instead
6929,however much she may enjoy such pursuits there will be times when she would actually rather wander the streets unaccompanied
6930,given that holt is presumably not volunteering himself to take@ care of her who will
6931,his view@ that letting children run in and out of busy airports smartly avoiding the traffic is perfectly reasonable depends upon@ a conception@ of a child which is far@ narrower@ than even the sex divide
6932,holt's child is actually the artful@ dodger@ mercifully not all children are
6933,there are other difficulties too
6934,it is not clear@ whether or not harris thinks that children of # should be obliged to take on full@ political status whether or not they want to but holt clearly does not
6935,he proposes that the rights privileges duties responsibilities of adult citizens be made@ to@ any young person of whatever age who wants to make@ use of them holt # p #
6936,if holt thinks that this@ proposal would remove@ an arbitrary boundary@ line@ between@ adults and children then he is mistaken
6937,the point@ about@ an adult citizen is that he has@ these@ rights privileges duties and responsibilities whether or not he wants them
6938,he may not exercise@ his rights or he may shirk his duties but he cannot forgo them
6939,they are not just to@ him they are his
6940,that@ is what being a citizen involves@ 
6941,rights and privileges do not pose any particular problems in@ the case of children
6942,holt can and does believe that children should have@ them as adults do and then leaves@ it up to@ the child to decide whether or not to exercise@ them
6943,but the same cannot be said@ for duties and responsibilities
6944,failure to exercise@ one's rights may be morally neutral failure to carry out one's duties is not
6945,it would be perfectly possible to give@ the rights to@ children without@ imposing the duties on@ them the one does not entail@ the other but we would then still be distinguishing@ between@ adults and children as citizens
6946,children still would not have@ full@ political status
6947,duties and responsibilities are not merely to@ a citizen they are an integral@ part@ of being a citizen
6948,holt does not want children to be obliged to take on any of these@ responsibilities and he manages@ to make@ his point@ by concentrating@ solely on@ the rights so that he can remark
6949,i do not say@ either that these@ rights and duties should be tied@ into@ one package@ that if a young person wants to assume any of them he must assume them all
6950,he should be able to pick@ and choose
6951,holt # p #
6952,if he can pick@ and choose i suggest he is not a citizen he does not have@ full@ political status and he is quite distinguishable@ on@ these@ grounds@ alone from@ the adults around@ him who do not have@ this@ option
6953,holt and harris both in@ the end@ face@ the same problem
6954,they attack@ the status quo by pointing@ out@ that the reasons given@ for denying rights to@ children are reasons and then explicitly or implicitly deny them duties for no reason at all
6955,whatever else such a strategy may achieve@ it certainly does not manage@ to produce@ a situation@ in@ which children are politically indistinguishable@ from@ adults and it rests@ on@ premises@ which unless they can be defended@ gain@ nothing for any defence@ to@ the charge@ of arbitrariness
6956,when in@ doubt go@ back@ to@ aristotle
6957,the trouble with@ all the views@ which we have looked@ at@ is that they tie@ the notion of autonomy@ firmly@ and solely to@ that@ of knowledge interpreted@ in@ either a broad@ or narrow@ sense@ 
6958,that it is firmly@ tied@ must be correct the inhabitants of brave@ new@ world@ are not autonomous@ precisely because they are denied access@ to@ relevant information
6959,relevant knowledge is a precondition of autonomy@ but it is not synonymous@ with@ it
6960,aristotle said@ something very interesting in@ that@ extract@ from@ the which i quoted earlier he said@ that women have@ a deliberative faculty but that it lacks full@ authority@ 
6961,what did he mean
6962,revival under@ law ##
6963,few contemporaries would have expectedbalfour's retirement to lead@ to@ a unionist recovery@ 
6964,the party was in@ a mutinous@ condition@ in@ november # and there was no apparent successor who would have@ even half of balfour's political gifts@ 
6965,nor was it clear@ that balfour's departure@ was universally desired at@ the national union conference a few days later leo maxse was booed off the platform and constituency parties everywhere passed@ resolutions regretting@ balfour's decision
6966,a great@ many crocodile tears were shed@ for since unionists had@ such an elevated@ view@ of the principle of leadership they were unable to acceptthat they had just driven@ their own leader from@ office
6967,the shock@ caused by balfour's going thus did@ something to steady@ the party and it certainly produced@ a real determination to settle@ the affairs of the party with@ less friction@ than had been fashionable of late
6968,the main contenders for the leadership were austen chamberlain and walter long representing the two different establishments of the edwardian unionist party the opposite@ worlds@ of birmingham and wiltshire but the situation@ was complicated by the intervention of two outsiders edward carson and andrew bonar law
6969,two strong@ groups@ emerged@ behind@ long and chamberlain about@ equal in@ numbers but there were few backers for carson or law
6970,carson thereupon fell@ out of@ the contest or rather announced@ that he was not standing@ for no official nominations had been made@ 
6971,the party officers and whips were solidly@ behind@ chamberlain but law drew@ off@ some of his support@ among@ tariff reformers and urged on by edward goulding and max aitken he refused to withdraw@ unless his continued candidature would allow@ long to win
6972,against@ chamberlain it was remembered that he was a liberal unionist as was lansdowne who led@ the unionists in@ the lords and that he had not been entirely loyal to@ balfour since the referendum pledge@ 
6973,long was supported@ by the bulk@ of the english county members@ but by few of the party's men of talent
6974,by@ the morning of friday # november it was clear@ that neither chamberlain nor long would secure@ a majority and that some supporters of each of them would not contentedly follow@ the other
6975,a party meeting was to be held@ on@ the following@ monday and the whips were making@ preparation for a vote to be taken@ 
6976,chamberlain provided the way@ out@ by suggesting to@ balcarres that both he and long should withdraw@ and so allow law to be elected unanimously he also turned@ down@ balcarres's remarkable advice that he should allow long to be elected since long would make@ such a mess@ of things@ that chamberlain would be bound@ to succeed within@ the year
6977,faced@ with@ chamberlain's proposition and without@ a majority of his own long had@ no option but to agree
6978,bonar law backed@ by fewer mps than any of the other three contenders at@ the beginning of the week was now to be the unanimous choice
6979,robert sanders reported the election meeting on@ # november with@ evident satisfaction
6980,the carlton meeting on@ monday went@ off@ quite admirably
6981,harry chaplin in@ the chair a very great@ success
6982,a good many men came into the room by no means inclined@ to acquiesce in@ the proposed arrangement@ 
6983,walter long proposed bonar law
6984,his speech was one of the best things@ i have heard
6985,manly@ and rather touching
6986,the country gentleman at@ his best
6987,he spoke and evidently felt@ strongly@ of the degradation that it would have been to@ the parry to have elected a leader by secret ballot
6988,austen followed@ 
6989,when austen sat down chaplin suggested that he had better put@ the question at once and on@ getting@ an affirmative shout did so
6990,a clever@ way@ of stifling@ discussion and few could have done it so well
6991,motion@ carried@ unanimously
6992,bonar law then sent for
6993,his speech struck@ me as the feeblest@ of the day
6994,he was evidently moved@ and nervous
6995,the meeting separated@ in@ great@ content with@ the conservative party all round@ 
6996,it was certainly creditable
6997,the urgency of the events following@ balfour's resignation was due to the need to find a new leader before@ the national union conference
6998,so within@ a few days of his grudging acceptance by his parliamentary colleagues law's leadership was ratified@ by the throng of party notables at leeds here he received a reception more typical of what was to come@ in@ the future
6999,in@ # law was known in so far as he was known at all in@ the parliamentary party as a spirited debater
7000,a
7001,p taylor has noted@ that law was trained@ if he was trained@ for anything in@ his early career to be a debater
7002,in glasgow he had picked@ up@ many of the skills that a more highly-born politician might have acquired@ in@ the oxford union or at@ the bar but skills that were very different in@ appearance@ 
7003,his concern was solely with@ effectiveness rather than style he rarely spoke with@ more than brief@ notes and left@ it to@ the occasion to furnish@ the words
7004,when he became chancellor of the exchequer this@ practice caused consternation at@ the treasury when he used only a page of notes to assist@ him in@ moving@ complicated@ resolutions on@ wartime finance he relied successfully on@ his memory to provide details@ and figures
7005,as an extempore speaker he was able to tailor his words to@ his audience's reactions@ and so convey@ the impression@ of personal conversation even when addressing thousands
7006,in@ parliament he was wont to abandon@ an argument half-completed if he sensed that his point@ had been made@ the speeches that appear@ in hansard were touched@ up@ by his staff and his speeches in the country were given to the press in@ advance@ 
7007,in@ debate he was a formidable opponent and one that asquith was never able to master for all his forensic skills
7008,again law succeeded by unorthodoxy he was quick@ to grasp@ the essentials@ of an opponent's argument and quite prepared to be rude@ or direct@ if the situation@ demanded@ it
7009,in@ the long@ debates over@ marconi in@ # and over@ the curragh mutiny in@ # law was able to nail@ asquith's evasions where@ a more polished@ stylist might have been foiled
7010,occasionally in@ the onrush@ of pursuit@ he gave@ commitments that were later regretted but these@ were a small@ price@ to pay@ 
7011,the unionist recovery@ was built@ around@ law's leadership but what asquith called the new@ style of obstruction@ threats and offensive@ behaviour did not originate with@ law
7012,the beginnings are to be found@ in@ the diehard campaign@ against@ the parliament bill
7013,it was in@ june # that the first scenes@ of disorder were mounted@ in@ the house of commons led@ by lord hugh cecil
7014,in@ august # the diehard peers used language as violent@ as any that law was to use later and in@ the crucial decision on@ the house of lords law sided with@ the hedgers rather than the ditchers@ 
7015,ulster's opposition to@ home rule long pre-dated law's leadership and he had rarely even spoken on@ irish affairs in@ parliament before@ becoming leader
7016,before he succeeded balfour then law was not associated with@ any of the features@ that were to characterize@ his party leadership his contribution@ was to use the leadership in@ the service@ of all of these@ causes to make@ himself the spokesman for the most spirited@ sections@ of the party
7017,law conceived of the role@ of the leader in@ an exactly opposite@ sense@ from@ balfour he sought@ to foster@ unity by placing@ himself at@ the head@ of the discordant@ elements@ where@ balfour had thrown@ the leadership on@ the side@ of restraint@ 
7018,their respective positions@ explain@ this@ in part as ex-prime minister and a considerable figure in@ his own right balfour had@ the confidence to believe in@ his own judgement even when isolated@ from@ the bulk@ of the party as the tertium quid in@ the recent contest law had@ neither the weight@ nor the confidence to take@ such a detached@ view@ 
7019,his strategy@ was rather to canalize@ the enthusiasm of the diehards into@ party channels@ to articulate@ their views@ and to create unity from@ the sense@ of movement@ 
7020,in@ his characteristic phrase i am their leader i must follow@ them but he determined to follow@ them from@ the front@ 
7021,as a result of this@ he was labelled@ as a diehard and a bigot when he actually distrusted the diehards and was himself distrusted by the bigots
7022,much of his leadership was thus a form@ of pragmatic extremism extreme@ action@ and the threat of more extreme action@ to come@ but used in@ the cause of more limited objectives
7023,he certainly held@ deep@ convictions@ as to the absolute wrongness of the liberal policies that he opposed but at least a part@ of his apparent hostility@ was assumed@ for the occasion a hard@ line@ that might secure@ a better compromise in@ the end@ 
7024,so in@ his first major speech as leader in@ parliament he wasted little time on@ the customary compliments and warned@ the government that he intended to play@ hard@ 
7025,in@ private conversation he told asquith i am afraid that i shall have to show@ myself very vicious@ mr asquith this@ session
7026,i hope you will understand
7027,in@ later conversations about@ ulster law was frank enough to point@ out@ that bloodshed in ulster would be the best way@ of ensuring an electoral landslide@ for the unionists
7028,there was then an open@ toughness@ about@ party tactics@ before@ the buckingham palace conference in@ # he had@ central office work@ out@ the electoral effects of excluding@ nine six or four counties of ulster from@ an independent ireland the concern of a calculating pragmatist not of a bigot
7029,from@ the party viewpoint@ law's methods were successful@ but dangerous@ expectations raised@ when the party was in@ full@ cry@ were not easily set@ aside@ for an eventual compromise and the only outcome that would fully vindicate the methods was the recovery@ of power@ 
7030,the basis of recovery@ was then law's fighting@ capacities@ as leader
7031,in@ parliament there would be a carefully organizedcampaign@ of resistance@ that would at least slow@ the government down@ and raise@ unionist morale
7032,improved morale would also make@ possible organizational advances@ outside@ parliament all linked@ to@ the issue of ulster and with@ the sights@ fixed@ firmly@ on@ the next@ election an election that would make@ or break@ the union the empire and law's leadership of the party
7033,all was linked@ to@ the sense@ of a new@ departure@ a new@ style a new@ regimein@ politics and a new team@ at@ the helm@ as well as a new leader the party had@ by@ the middle@ of # a new chief whip party chairman party treasurer principal agent press adviser and an almost entirely new team@ of whips and organizers
7034,party organization provided the easiest advances@ because it was the only area@ entirely under@ the party's control@ 
7035,no general election was fought@ by the organization set@ up@ after@ # but there is little doubt that there was a massive@ improvement criticisms that were commonplace in@ # were not to be heard@ by@ #
7036,the space available to@ central office was increased by the acquisition of st stephen's house as well as st stephen's chambers which had been occupied since # the new office cost # a year in@ rent alone@ 
7037,the quality of the senior@ staff was improved by the appointment of three specialists
7038,john boraston took over as principal agent in@ # having been a professional organizer all his career and latterly chief agent to@ the liberal unionist council
7039,he joined@ william jenkins appointed chief organizingagent in@ # and previously district agent for the midlands liberal unionists
7040,the party was indeed handed@ over@ to@ birmingham
7041,finally malcolm fraser ex-editor of the standard and of the daily express became first honorary press adviser and subsequently was employed to run@ the press bureau at@ the colossal salary of #
7042,steel-maitland boraston jenkins and fraser made up a team@ of experts all of sufficient status to deal@ with@ politicians who might call into the office the work@ of the office was departmentalized for the first time and the heads@ of department brought@ together@ into@ a supervising board
7043,the influence of central office toned@ up@ the rest of the organization
7044,a new@ canvass system@ was introduced@ in@ # so that all county constituencies would operate@ the same system@ and so that duplicate records could be kept@ at@ area@ level@ 
7045,this@ was important at@ a time when outvoters were a larger group@ in@ many constituencies than the size of the majority and when the outvoters were overwhelmingly unionist
7046,in@ # a register of car owners was compiled also important when some voters could cast@ several votes in@ an election when polling went@ several days
7047,by@ november # only fifty-one constituencies in great britain were without@ candidates a much better position@ than the position@ at@ dissolution in@ either # or # few of these@ fifty-one constituencies were winnable but in@ any case most of them had@ candidates by@ the end@ of #
7048,a programme of speakers for a general election was also ready@ by@ # with@ both constituencies and politicians told in@ advance@ what they might expect@ 
7049,the financial mismanagement that had reigned@ before@ # was ended with@ the employment of professional accountants
7050,expenditure on@ central office district offices and the london office doubled@ from@ # in@ ## to@ # in@ ## the total expenditure of the party organization from@ central@ funds also doubled@ from@ # to@ over@ #
7051,to pay for this@ outpouring a great@ drive@ was mounted@ for additional income -by farquhar and steel-maitland
7052,in@ # ordinary subscriptions still brought@ in@ only # a year and it proved difficult to raise@ them to@ anything like what was needed
7053,the method adopted@ was to canvass for capital donations that could then be invested to bring@ in@ a regular@ income and both balfour and law were used to raise@ the wind@ 
7054,steel-maitland told balfour that farquhar and i are endeavouring to raise@ more money
7055,i think we are likely to succeed thanks in part to@ the very generous example set@ by lord rothschild
7056,but i would b e very glad if i might see you on@ your return to ask you to help me in@ two cases
7057,systematic collections were made@ from peers and from@ the city by@ the outbreak of war the invested funds amounted to@ # twice the sum in@ # and worth four years expenditure and there was a special cash deposit@ of # for the coming election
7058,in@ three other areas@ as much political as organizational advances@ were made@ towards@ the management of the press the coordination@ of the heterogeneous collection that made up the party and the fostering@ of modern attitudes@ in@ the local parties
7059,under@ malcolm fraser the party began@ to make@ effective use of its support@ in@ fleet street
7060,it had been recognized@ that liberals had been more adept at@ handling@ the press because they were more ready to stoop@ to@ newspaper practices as sandars had reported in@ #
7061,i told northcliffe that if his people would make@ enquiries at@ our central office he would find@ that our nightly regiment@ of speakers was at least as well worth@ reporting as the radical contingent@ but that i realized that from@ the press point@ of view@ no doubt our speakers did not play up to the reporters by handing@ them their speeches in@ advance@ and by other tricks of the kind to which the radical orators have@ recourse
7062,this@ was the essence@ of the problem the press could only be managed@ by someone who knew their methods and who would not expect them to come round to central office to search@ for news
7063,the uoc found@ that it is patent that some feeling@ exists among@ the unionist press that while in@ the past they have done much for the party the party has not assisted@ in@ their work
7064,in@ many quarters@ it is asserted that the unionist press are treatedwith@ greater@ courtesy by the radicals than by their own side@ 
7065,fraser dealt@ with@ this@ problem without@ difficulty and explained to@ law in@ # that the importance of getting important speeches in@ advance@ is shown@ in@ concrete@ manner by your wallsend speech on@ october #th
7066,the verbatim reports reached@ most of the newspapers in places such as aberdeen at@ one o clock in@ the morning of the #th
7067,he went@ on@ to quote the response that had been receivedfrom editors
7068,manchester dispatch i hope you will continue this@ form@ of enterprise
7069,you fully know as an old@ pressman the difficulty of dealing@ with@ a big@ speech late at@ night
7070,daily express i am much obliged to@ you for the precis of mr bonar law's speech last night
7071,it was a great@ help to@ us
7072,the speech came@ over@ the wires so late and the sheets@ were so confused by the post office which is usual in@ these@ cases that without@ the precis we could not possibly have got the leader@ throughin@ time for the first edition
7073,so in@ the supply of information to@ newspapers predisposed@ to support@ the party much was achieved merely by employing a specialist
7074,the other side@ of press management depending on informal contacts@ is less easy to assess@ 
7075,in@ # steel-maitland invited blumenfeld of the daily express to central office for a two-way exchange@ of ideas and advice
7076,he also used law himself to impress@ editors who were on@ less familiar terms with@ fraser as with@ marlowe of the daily mail and law took@ a direct@ interest in@ negotiations with@ the most difficult of all the unionist editors j l garvin of the observer
7077,law personally conducted@ the negotiations with@ gardner sinclair over@ the sale of the observer and the pall mall gazette in@ # this@ negotiation also demonstrates@ that as well as producing@ information and nursing@ editors the party had to work@ hard@ to keep some of the newspapers in@ business
7078,sinclair did buy the observer and the pall mall in@ the end@ but not before he had been given@ a # guarantee from@ party funds
7079,such investments had@ a double@ purpose for they could bring@ in@ income and provide a political bonus@ 
7080,one such scheme involved the purchase of the daily express by max aitken with@ party funds but the party was also propping@ up@ the globe the standard and a wide@ range@ of provincial dailies
7081,all these@ transactions were secret for there would be little use in@ keeping a paper alive@ if it were known to be owned@ by a political party
7082,the papers were therefore bought through@ nominees or bank loans backed@ with@ party capital
7083,it was usual to extract@ some form@ of guarantee in@ exchange@ for party support@ but the secrecy prevented such undertakings from@ being enforced
7084,sinclair thus gave@ an undertaking that his papers would always remain unionist but steel-maitland doubted if such a promise had@ any value@ 
7085,the later history of the daily express suggests@ not when the express became hostile@ in@ the # younger raged when i think of the large@ sum of money this@ office has put@ into@ that@ gutter@ print it makes@ my blood boil@ 
7086,the justification@ for pouring@ out@ large@ sums without@ a certain return@ was the even greater@ cost of any real alternative
7087,the support@ for the express in@ # provides for the introduction of # or # to retain the only half-penny paper the party possesses@ in london and no less a sum than # to@ # # would be necessary to start a similar paper if the daily express were allowed@ to go@ 
7088,the struggle@ therefore went@ on@ to keep the unionist press alive@ and in@ # and # both aitken and northcliffe stood@ by@ the party and gave@ valuable@ support@ in@ their papers
7089,the coordination@ of competing party bodies@ was carried out with@ surprising ease
7090,the national union was merged with@ central office in@ # and fusion@ with@ the liberal unionists followed@ in@ #
7091,joseph chamberlain retained his preference for independence but allowed himself to be overruled@ by austen and by the overwhelming wishes@ of the liberal unionist council to merge
7092,to cater@ for all susceptibilities the party became the national unionist association of conservative and unionist associations a decision that allowed@ some local parties to go@ on@ calling themselves conservative but the name liberal was at last dropped@ 
7093,the liberal unionists were admitted@ to@ the carlton club and a longstanding source@ of tension@ was eradicated
7094,this@ was in@ itself a striking commentary@ on@ what had already been done liberal unionists who had resisted@ amalgamation under@ balfour and acland-hood in@ # acquiesced meekly under@ law and steel-maitland in@ #
7095,other organizations could not be absorbed@ but could still be brought@ within@ the central office orbit@ 
7096,so in@ # steel-maitland offered to join@ the halsbury club in order to guide@ it on@ to@ safer@ lines@ and was immediately@ accused of disloyalty by walter long
7097,long helped though by placing@ both steel-maitland and boraston on@ the executive committee of the union defence league for the same purpose
7098,steel-maitland also explained to@ lord robert cecil that it has been arranged@ that the national conservative union should send@ out@ leaflets produced by several of the ancillary organizations such as the tariff reform league the anti-socialist union the primrose league the london municipal society etc
7099,the central office attitude@ was flexible@ for outside@ bodies@ would always exist and could even be made@ use of
7100,they represent@ a time when either their objects@ were not the same as those@ of the official organization or the cco was not enterprising@ enough to suit@ them
7101,but some caution should be observed@ 
7102,it may be wise while retaining or regaining control@ to trade under@ different names
7103,in@ some cases additional subscriptions may be obtained in@ others full@ responsibility may be avoided@ 
7104,with@ open@ allies@ like the primrose league the case for collaboration was strong@ for the first time in@ thirty years of existence the primrose league formally linked@ itself with@ the party in@ #
7105,on@ the other hand@ the independence of the tariff reform league was a positive advantage after@ january # the party supported@ the tariff policy but was not including them in@ its immediate@ programme so that central office could continue to distribute@ tariff propaganda from@ the trl without@ compromising party policy
7106,in general efforts to ensure better coordination@ were a matter of the patient building@ up@ of contacts@ although the improved party morale and the greater@ efficiency of central office had removed@ their justification@ for existence
7107,twenty-eight
7108,nairobi
7109,we start with@ a young man thomas fairfax in military khaki and flying jacket climbing into his old biplane and taxiing down@ a runway
7110,he adjusts the flaps zips up his jacket pulls down his goggles
7111,the runway is simply a strip of grass cleared of rocks
7112,the plane lurches@ into@ motion
7113,it bounces alarmingly as it gathers@ speed
7114,a few africans clutching sticks and wearing skins watch the plane as it turns@ pauses@ and then accelerates leaving@ a cloud@ of dust
7115,the plane climbs@ reluctantly@ one set of wings@ dipping@ drunkenly@ 
7116,soon it is passing over the spectacular rift valley
7117,there is no sign@ of civilization but herds of zebra and wildebeest and clumps@ of elephants marble@ the valley floor@ 
7118,ol doinyo lengai
7119,a group of masai is clearing stones from a stretch@ of grassland in the shadow of the mountain of god
7120,a large white cross has been painted roughly on the ground
7121,claudia cohn-casson is sitting under an enormous african fig tree near by at a camp table spread with a somali cloth
7122,she has in front of her a typewriter her recorder and her notes
7123,a servant is preparing lunch on a fire
7124,claudia hears something
7125,she looks up into the sky in@ the direction of ol doinyo lengai
7126,we catch@ sight of a small plane circling the mountain
7127,it dips@ its wings@ in@ acknowledgement@ of the landing strip and circles preparing@ to land
7128,claudia stands up
7129,she checks her appearance in@ a mirror hanging on a tree
7130,with her lower lip she tucks the upper lip into her mouth for a moment
7131,she is wearing a long fitted skirt of khaki
7132,she adjusts her hat a round bush hat and walks towards the makeshift landing strip
7133,the plane is taxiing pursued by a group of running masai warriors glorious in their red and purple robes ochred hair lion head-dresses and so on
7134,claudia walks over towards the plane
7135,she holds her hat on her head with one hand
7136,the plane is still now surrounded by the warriors
7137,fairfax is securing its wheels with rocks
7138,he looks up to see her approaching
7139,behind her is ol doinyo lengai
7140,its strange shape has become familiar@ to@ us
7141,his face is still dirty from@ the dust and oil except that around his eyes is a white patch where the goggles were
7142,the masai begin to sing
7143,it is a strange other-worldly noise
7144,claudia and fairfax approach each other
7145,the moment is unnaturally poignantly delayed
7146,in his uniform jacket unzipped he is handsome and smiling
7147,the singing of the masai and the overwhelming landscape are thrilling
7148,claudia and fairfax come closer
7149,she is serene
7150,he is perhaps surprised@ by her composure
7151,she kisses him three times
7152,i am so glad you came
7153,her accent is very french but she speaks english fluently@ 
7154,anything to help a friend
7155,fairfax is awkward
7156,he would like to say something more graceful@ 
7157,your face is dirty
7158,you look how you say a raccoon@ 
7159,fairfax laughs
7160,he wipes his face with his sleeve
7161,sorry
7162,i have prepared the lunch
7163,she touches his arm lightly
7164,they start to walk the short distance to her camp
7165,the throng of masai surrounds them
7166,her servant brings a bowl of hot water for fairfax
7167,he washes his face
7168,the masai watch all this@ 
7169,fairfax and claudia sit down on camp chairs
7170,the masai stand a short distance off curious but self-absorbed
7171,what would you like to drink 
7172,can you manage@ a brandy and soda
7173,i think so
7174,she speaks swahili to@ the servant
7175,now do you want to tell me all the facts
7176,as far@ as i know them
7177,yes
7178,the masai who has been arrested tepilit is from this@ district

7180,he was supposed to deliver a bull to the district officer it was about@ three weeks ago and he decided at@ the last moment to replace the bull with another one
7181,but the district officer miles turnbull would not accept it
7182,her face as she removes her hat and begins to speak is startlingly beautiful although not conventionally
7183,fairfax watches her
7184,as she talks the servant brings the drinks and then the lunch a grilled fowl with some preserves
7185,as she speaks we see a masai market
7186,spread@ around are hundreds of masai men and women
7187,some of the women are in robes of blue others are in brown dyed skins
7188,the older men have blankets loosely slung over their shoulders
7189,almost every man is accompanied@ by a goat or a cow held on a short leather thong or controlled@ by a thin stick
7190,those@ animals are accustomed to@ the masai
7191,there is incongruously an open car to one side of the market
7192,from it into the colourful throng appears a young british district officer miles turnbull
7193,he is carrying some papers and is accompanied by two askaris with rifles and an interpreter dressed in khakis
7194,the askaris wear military sweaters sam brownes shorts and socks
7195,on their heads they wear fezes
7196,the whole@ thing@ was ridiculous and tragic@ 
7197,this@ man was very much liked by the masai
7198,but he was overworked
7199,he had to collect the cattle and make@ sure that every boma was contributing his fair@ share
7200,his district stretches@ nearly one hundred and fifty miles
7201,i liked him even though he was a little bit boring
7202,he was so english
7203,he could not speak masai so he always was accompanied by this@ man a nandi who i am afraid does not speak masai very good 
7204,very well
7205,sorry
7206,very well
7207,so the laibon's son from up@ there@ up@ the valley past lengai he is a descendant of mbatian the great@ laibon he tries to persuade turnbull to let him take out his animal from the ones which have been selected 
7208,the young warrior tepilit is arguing with@ the district officer
7209,he is still vividly scarred from@ his recent encounter@ with@ a lion
7210,his face is painted and he is carrying a spear
7211,on his head he wears a head-dress of lion mane
7212,turnbull explains through@ the interpreter that time is short@ it is late there is a great@ war on@ with@ the germans
7213,he cannot wait for the proposed exchange of animals
7214,but he tries to be reasonable
7215,how long@ will it take@ anyway
7216,tomorrow it will be ready
7217,i will bring it
7218,it will be too late
7219,tell him that i am very sorry but i cannot make@ exceptions
7220,he has had@ plenty of time
7221,the masai warrior tepilit is excited
7222,a number of other masai gather round
7223,he says that this@ particular animal is a favourite
7224,he strokes its side which is white and marked with round patches of black islands@ on@ a navely@ drawn@ map@ 
7225,it is a beautiful animal with huge curved horns
7226,i will bring you two cattle tomorrow
7227,i will go now and deliver them myself to narok
7228,tell him i am very sorry but i must fill@ the quota
7229,turnbull busies himself with his clipboard as his reply is translated
7230,take the animal now he says to@ his assistant gently
7231,as they move forward tepilit without@ warning hurls his spear at@ the district officer from a few feet away
7232,it is a heavy weapon
7233,between the knife-shaped iron blade and the tapered tail@ of the spear is a rounded handle made from a particularly hard tree
7234,this@ piece of wood passes right through turnbull so that he is skewered
7235,a fountain@ of blood at first pours from his chest but soon subsides@ become a steady@ trickle
7236,tepilit watches as the district officer performs a brief@ hokey-cokey@ before falling face down
7237,this@ drives the spear almost completely through his body
7238,nobody moves
7239,the watching masai begin to walk away after@ a long@ contemplative moment
7240,they seem to be weighing@ the incident carefully in@ their minds
7241,the askaris panic
7242,they cock@ their rifles and fire into the air
7243,now they guard the body which is motionless in a lake@ of blood that is rapidly drying@ drunk@ by the thirsty@ insatiable@ soil
7244,you can almost hear the soil gulping@ 
7245,tepilit drives his bull away
7246,he walks without@ a backward glance
7247,he has in one hand a stick and is followed by a thin dog
7248,this@ little group begins to mount a hill
7249,nobody makes@ a move to stop him
7250,the strange singing of the masai rises@ 
7251,from a distance we see tepilit walking steadily towards ol doinyo lengai with his animals
7252,they are tiny figures in a huge landscape
7253,fairfax has finished eating but claudia's food is untouched
7254,the next day he presented himself for arrest
7255,did you know this@ man
7256,i knew his family well
7257,did you see him after the killing
7258,he came to my house and told me what had happened
7259,and you told him to give himself up
7260,of course
7261,what else should i do
7262,i'm just asking
7263,if i can do anything i must know the facts
7264,the facts are not so clear@ 
7265,this@ man tepilit was injured helping me with@ the filming of a lion hunt
7266,now i must help him
7267,when is the trial
7268,it's not arranged yet
7269,but i have tried to talk to@ him to persuade him to say that he thought the askaris were going to shoot him or that it was a misunderstanding but he refuse absolutely to excuse himself
7270,i'll talk to@ him
7271,i'll talk to@ the dc
7272,i heard about@ the lion hunt
7273,sounds a bit@ of a balls-up
7274,a balls-up
7275,it was worse than a balls-up
7276,it was a disaster
7277,his brother was killed
7278,all for a film
7279,and that@ bastard@ do you speak french leavitt walked away very happy
7280,he was the producer
7281,he was an exploiter
7282,he didn't care about@ the masai
7283,he wanted blood any blood
7284,lions masai all equal
7285,why do you think he did it
7286,the moran i mean
7287,i don't know
7288,there is a pause
7289,shall we take@ some coffee now
7290,claudia summons her servant who brings a coffee pot
7291,i'll go and see him tomorrow
7292,don't worry@ 
7293,the jail at ngiro narok
7294,it is a small police post with cells at the back@ 
7295,in front of the building is a row of white-painted stones and some cactus-like sisal plants forming a circle around a patch of grass
7296,in the middle of the grass is a flagpole from which the union jack hangs
7297,a car pulls up outside
7298,an askari salutes as fairfax steps out of the car in uniform
7299,he enters the building
7300,a young white policeman appears from his office reluctantly
7301,he straightens up and salutes fairfax
7302,sorry major
7303,i'm sergeant jeavons sir
7304,major fairfax
7305,i want to talk to@ the masai man you are holding@ 
7306,i have the papers
7307,are you the defence@ sir
7308,no i'm here to make@ a report to@ the governor
7309,the sergeant's face is elaborately@ composed@ 
7310,in a bare@ mud-walled cell sitting on the floor is tepilit
7311,he does not appear to be disheartened
7312,he looks at fairfax without@ fear
7313,from behind the sergeant an askari shouts at@ tepilit
7314,stand up man
7315,attention 
7316,fairfax speaks to@ tepilit in@ maa
7317,i hope you are well tepilit ole saibol
7318,then he turns to the policeman that@'s fine@ sergeant
7319,you may leave me here
7320,fairfax shakes hands with tepilit and sits on small stool
7321,tepilit squats on the floor
7322,how are you
7323,i am fine@ 
7324,what age group are you
7325,botorok
7326,is your father the laibon
7327,yes
7328,he is descended@ from@ mbatian
7329,you have killed a lion
7330,hooh
7331,i am praised because i held it by the tail
7332,does your father have many cattle
7333,we are owners of many cattle
7334,i am happy
7335,do you know me
7336,you are the friend of claudia from@ the government 
7337,i am a friend of claudia
7338,i am a soldier
7339,at@ the moment as you know the white people and their friends are fighting with@ the germans
7340,this@ is a very big@ war
7341,our people also fought the germans
7342,your people fought very bravely
7343,the masai are brave
7344,we know this@ 
7345,we honour the masai above@ all people
7346,what do you want to discuss
7347,i am here because i was asked to come by claudia
7348,she wants me to talk to@ you
7349,there is no need
7350,i have told her everything that happened
7351,she is unhappy
7352,she does not want you to be tried by the government
7353,we are betrothed
7354,she is my little heifer@ 
7355,fairfax is stunned@ 
7356,it takes@ him a moment to regain his composure
7357,you are going to be married
7358,she must first ask her father who lives far away 
7359,do you realize what will happen to@ you if you are tried
7360,tepilit makes@ a gesture by placing his hand to his throat and cupping it
7361,i can't see@ any point@ in@ that@ 
7362,when you killed the district officer it was an accident
7363,i killed him on@ purpose
7364,what i want to say is this@ there was a misunderstanding
7365,i will tell the government
7366,you thought the nandi the fat belly wanted the askaris to shoot you
7367,no
7368,i did not
7369,the white man told the askaris to take my animal after i had offered to exchange it
7370,he took my best animal even though i offered two in@ its place@ 
7371,that@ is why i killed him
7372,and now my family have offered forty-nine cattle to@ his family but the government will not take them to give to@ his family in england
7373,white men have@ different customs
7374,they don't like cattle
7375,some like cattle
7376,i have many cattle on my farm
7377,are they milk cattle living in a house as i have heard
7378,not all
7379,many are masai cattle
7380,tepilit ole saibol i have@ a heavy@ burden@ 
7381,only you can help me
7382,i have to talk to@ the governor
7383,i have to explain to@ him what happened
7384,the nandi man has run away frightened
7385,i can say to@ the governor that you misunderstood the order@ and tried to defend yourself
7386,not the district officer's order@ but the translator's who spoke too fast without@ proper consideration as nandi people do and the askaris pointed their guns at you
7387,you threw the spear wildly
7388,unfortunately the district officer stepped forward
7389,if i tell him that@ they will fine you
7390,many of my people saw me
7391,they know that i killed him on@ purpose because he took my best animal
7392,if you say that@ at@ your trial they will kill you
7393,i have offered cattle to@ his family
7394,i can do no more
7395,fairfax stands up
7396,think about@ what i said
7397,i will come back 
7398,go in@ peace
7399,please god
7400,tepilit does not stand up
7401,he seems content
7402,the sergeant meets fairfax outside the cell
7403,all right sir
7404,not really
7405,has he made@ a statement
7406,yes sir
7407,he admits@ killing the do
7408,no excuses
7409,can i read his statement
7410,i'm afraid it's gone@ off@ to the high court sir
7411,you haven't got a copy here
7412,we haven't had any carbon paper for two years sir
7413,was it taken@ down@ by a policeman
7414,yes sir
7415,by me sir
7416,do you speak masai
7417,no sir but we got the larusa translator in
7418,he's the official police translator sir
7419,we read it back@ to@ the man twice
7420,it took@ me most of a whole@ day sir
7421,in the cell tepilit sits motionless on the floor
7422,at claudia's camp it is almost evening
7423,the light in the sky is there by courtesy@ of the vanished@ sun but the tops of the mountains are still golden@ honey@ had been poured@ lightly@ over@ them
7424,fairfax's car appears the lights hopping@ and bouncing down@ the track
7425,claudia rises
7426,fairfax steps out of the car
7427,claudia comes to greet him and kisses him lightly on both cheeks
7428,how was he
7429,stubborn
7430,he would not agree
7431,no 
7432,would you like something to drink
7433,they are approaching the fire
7434,fairfax stops 
7435,he told me you two were pakiteng little heifers@ 
7436,it's true@ 
7437,i didn't know what it meant@ 
7438,i did not take@ it seriously
7439,did you accept any gifts
7440,he was very sick after the lion got him and he gave me his necklace
7441,he was in@ a fever
7442,i had@ no idea he wanted me to marry him when he has his head shaved
7443,what a balls-up
7444,claudia the problem is that one masai cruel as this@ may sound is not considered very important
7445,i have flown my plane with cadged army fuel six hundred miles
7446,i am supposed to be at ghq
7447,they won't hold@ up@ proceedings while we talk to@ him
7448,i've only got@ until@ tomorrow
7449,please tom
7450,she touches his arm
7451,please tom
7452,it is completely crazy
7453,there's a war the germans are trying to kill every jew in the world and you are going to hang one masai because of a misunderstanding
7454,there's no misunderstanding unfortunately
7455,he seems determined to die
7456,determined to die
7457,can you talk to@ his family
7458,i will try
7459,i will also get the translation of his evidence
7460,maybe i can put@ some doubts into@ the governor's mind about@ its admissibility
7461,a boma near ol doinyo lengai
7462,fairfax and claudia are meeting the masai
7463,they are sitting on stools in the middle of the cattle enclosure talking to@ tepilit's father sentue
7464,around them graceful masai women in long leather skirts are sweeping the boma and plastering the huts with cow dung
7465,in@ the distance we can hear cowbells
7466,sentue is a grand dignified figure of about@ sixty-five
7467,he is wearing a blue tunic and around his shoulders is a fur cloak made of the skins of the hyrax
7468,in his hands he holds a snuff box shaped like a small quiver and a thin stick
7469,two warriors one of whom is saibol tepilit's younger brother stand at a distance
7470,sentue is speaking
7471,it is clear@ that he has been speaking for some time
7472,we have@ many problems with@ the government
7473,they want to take our cows to pay for the war
7474,we give them our cows
7475,every time they collect our cows they promise to give us something in@ return but the next@ time ask for more cows
7476,our cows are our life
7477,i am a rich man
7478,i have many cows and many children
7479,i have offered many cows to pay this@ man's family
7480,but the government wants to take@ away my son also
7481,why do they do this@ 
7482,this@ is the way@ our law is
7483,you cannot kill a man deliberately
7484,if you have been reasonable if you are offering your own wealth two cows instead of one and he will not listen if he thinks you are a small@ man and will not listen to@ your suggestions why not
7485,you must kill him
7486,you can't kill a white man in@ this@ way@ 
7487,a white man has blood red blood also
7488,the white man has blood
7489,that@ is true@ 
7490,but the white man does not believe that cattle are payment for taking@ someone's life
7491,the masai sentue finds@ this@ hard@ to believe
7492,he turns his old head wearily as if to indicate to@ his family the kind of people he has to deal@ with@ these@ days
7493,claudia speaks your son must say it was an accident
7494,major fairfax will speak to@ the government
7495,i told my son only trouble could come@ from@ being your pakiteng
7496,the old man says this@ without@ rancour
7497,it is in@ his mind a fact
7498,claudia is upset
7499,she touches fairfax's arm for support@ 
7500,fairfax shouts you are a stupid man
7501,this@ woman has come from far away to write about@ your people
7502,she did not understand what your son wanted from@ her
7503,why does he want to marry a white woman
7504,does he think she will spend@ the rest of her life milking his cows and goats
7505,don't be stupid 
7506,sentue takes@ a few moments to reply
7507,there is nothing wrong with@ milking cows and goats
7508,claudia interrupts
7509,ole sentue i agree with@ you
7510,i have to go to my country to see my father
7511,i am sure he would wish me to marry with@ someone in@ our tribe
7512,but in@ any case i cannot marry your son
7513,in our country to exchange gifts does not mean@ the same thing@ 
7514,i was a stupid woman
7515,i did not understand
7516,because you have come here my son is going to be killed
7517,hanged a chicken@ by his neck in town
7518,no no please
7519,major fairfax will help him
7520,but he must help himself
7521,she is weeping
7522,fairfax approaches very close to the laibon between them
7523,the laibon speaks to@ claudia ignoring him
7524,how can fahfakhs save him
7525,your people do not believe it is right to offer cows to@ his family
7526,fahfakhs said that@ 
7527,they want to kill him
7528,he did nothing to@ them but they want to kill him
7529,i have looked at the stones
7530,they will kill him
7531,fairfax grasps the old man by his wrist
7532,laibon great-grandson of mbatian you must think again
7533,the white people are having@ a war with@ the germans
7534,the masai have been good friends
7535,the government will help your son but he must not say that he killed the white man on@ purpose
7536,ole sentue simel you must speak to@ your son
7537,the laibon simply looks down at the floor of the boma
7538,he is not prepared@ to discuss this@ dishonourable argument
7539,his face is adamantine
7540,claudia rises
7541,she offers her hand in@ the masai manner her head bowed
7542,stay in@ peace
7543,tom we must go
7544,go in@ peace
7545,they leave the boma
7546,the laibon stands to watch them go
7547,they walk together towards their car
7548,there are tears in claudia's eyes
7549,she turns to fairfax
7550,he will not talk to@ his son
7551,he strides stiffly and angrily 
7552,claudia you are supposed to understand them
7553,what can he tell him
7554,can he say to@ him you must stop being a masai
7555,you must tell lies like the muzungus
7556,i will try to get@ him off@ 
7557,but i'm not so sure now if it's possible
7558,you must do it tom
7559,my work here will be finished if he is hanged
7560,i can't support@ it
7561,it's too terrible
7562,they climb into the car and set off
7563,behind them ol doinyo lengai is catching@ the late afternoon sunlight
7564,they drive down into a dry watercourse and are surrounded by hundreds of cattle returning from their grazing driven by children and young warriors
7565,they cut@ the engine to allow the animals to pass undisturbed
7566,claudia sits with her eyes downcast
7567,a child greets her but a young warrior strikes the child with a stick
7568,my heart is breaking@ she says
7569,fairfax turns to her
7570,her face is shaded from@ him in the failing light
7571,i will do what i can i promise
7572,she kisses fairfax
7573,they sit in the dust of the vanished cattle
7574,claudia you are beautiful
7575,you look so beautiful
7576,i can't bear@ it that you are unhappy
7577,did you love him
7578,i have to ask
7579,you know that@ is an impossible question
7580,in@ one way@ i loved them all
7581,i have lived here for nearly five years
7582,sometimes for many months i was the only white person for hundreds of miles
7583,i was very grateful to@ him
7584,i was guilty because he was nearly killed
7585,another man was killed in@ the ridiculous filming
7586,i believed i owed him some debt
7587,that@ boy will do anything for me even up to getting himself killed by a lion
7588,so i loved him
7589,yes i loved him but i loved him in@ my masai self
7590,do you understand me
7591,do you know what my professor said
7592,he said that the most important thing@ in the world i mean our world is to live 
7593,i believed i was the first anthropologist in france to understand what this@ means@ 
7594,i was trying to live the real masai life 
7595,is that@ possible
7596,obviously not
7597,but at least i was not trying to stand@ completely outside@ this@ life with my little notebook
7598,i can't leave this@ district with@ one man hanged and another killed and somehow because of me
7599,i can't
7600,my life would be finished@ 
7601,you have to help me tom 
7602,#
7603,steady@ currents@ 
7604,#
7605,the basic equations
7606,in@ this@ chapter we shall be concerned with@ phenomena in@ which the main role@ is played@ by the current@ of charged@ particles
7607,all our variables can be functions@ of space but are independent of time
7608,it is easy to present@ the relevant equations we have@ all of eqns # -# but have to substitute@ a at = o yielding@ [formula]@ 
7609,there is a difficulty with@ eqn #
7610,it is correct for most of the chapter with@ [formula]@ taken@ as a constant but breaks@ down@ for ferromagnetic materials which will be discussed in@ section@ #
7611,all the other equations are all right but will not necessarily provide the simplest@ starting@ point@ for solving a given problem
7612,we shall therefore introduce@ a number of alternative formulations@ 
7613,first we could search@ for some analogue of the potential@ function@ which proved so useful in@ electrostatics
7614,we found@ there@ that bychoosing a scalar@ function@ in@ the form@ [formula]@ we could automatically@ satisfy@ the other equation for the electric field@ strength@ [formula]@ 
7615,can we do the same thing@ for the magnetic quantities
7616,no but we can do a similar thing@ 
7617,since it is the equation [formula]@ that needs to be satisfied@ we should choose the potential@ as a vector called@ not without@ logic the vector potential@ defined@ bythe equation [formula]@ 
7618,substituting@ the above@ equation into@ eqn # we get@ [formula]@ or usingthe vector relation eqn a# we obtain@ the modified form@ [formula]@ 
7619,this@ equation can be further@ simplified to@ [formula]@ bychoosing in@ the physicist's jargon this@ is called@ choosing the gauge@ [formula]@ 
7620,can we do that@ 
7621,one can't usually assign@ some arbitrary value@ to@ the divergence of a vector function@ 
7622,in@ the present@ case however we do have@ some freedom@ of choice
7623,the definition of a byeqn # is not unique
7624,if we add to@ a the gradient@ of a scalar@ function@ the resulting vector a' still gives@ the same magnetic field@ because [formula]@ 
7625,hence a suitable choice of will ensure that [formula]@ 
7626,so we are left@ with@ eqn #
7627,if the current@ density@ is specified eqn # will provide the solution for a from@ which b can be determined
7628,how can we find@ a solution for a
7629,there is nothing easier
7630,we only need to remember the differential equation for the scalar@ potential@ [formula]@ eqn # and its solution in@ the form@ of eqn #
7631,byanalogy the general solution of eqn # is [formula]@ 
7632,a simple@ integration@ will yield@ a if j is given@ 
7633,we shall go@ through@ a number of examples later
7634,for the moment let us use the above@ expression@ for deriving@ biot-savart's law@ 
7635,first we shall assume@ that the current@ density@ is confined to@ a thin wire in@ which case the integration@ variable may be changed to@ [formula]@ where@ s is a vector normal to@ the cross-section [formula]@ is the area of the cross-section and di is an elementary vector along@ the tangent of the wire
7636,noting further@ that js = i and that i must be constant@ along the wire we may write eqn # in@ the modified form@ [formula]@ whence the magnetic field@ strength@ is [formula]@ 
7637,we have to stop@ here@ for a moment to sort@ out@ the coordinates
7638,as may be seen in@ fig # the coordinates of the wire element are x' y' z' whereas the coordinates of the point where we wish to determine the magnetic field@ are set of coordinates
7639,thus the curl@ operates@ on@ the coordinates of p but not on@ those@ of dl leading@ to@ [formula]@ where@ ir is the unit vector in@ the direction r and we have made@ use of the vector relation a# in@ the appendix
7640,this@ is biot-savart's law@ derived@ directly@ from@ maxwell's equations
7641,are there any other ways@ of determining the magnetic field@ 
7642,well one can useeqn # as it is but very often one is better off byusing its integral form@ that can be obtained@ byintegrating@ both sides@ of eqn # over a surface [formula]@ 
7643,byusing@ stokes' theorem for the left-hand-side@ and recognizing that the integral of the current@ density@ gives@ the current@ the above@ equation reduces@ to@ [formula]@ where@ the line@ integration@ is along the curve c enclosing the surface
7644,the positive@ sense@ of the integration@ path@ is defined relative to the positive@ current@ direction according to the usual right-hand@ convention@ 
7645,equation # is known as ampre's law@ 
7646,we have@ now a number of equations describing@ the same thing
7647,which equation should we usein@ a practical case the equation for the vector potential@ ampre's law@ biot-savart's law@ or attack@ directly@ maxwell's equations
7648,it's hard@ to tell@ 
7649,experience with@ practical calculations helps@ but even after@ years of work one usually remains@ this@ side@ of infallibility
7650,i regret to say@ that there are no general guidelines available
7651,if one manages@ to find@ the simplest@ method at@ the first attempt that can mostly be attributed to@ good luck
7652,can we claim then@ that the vector potential@ is as useful as its scalar@ counterpart in@ electrostatics
7653,for computational purposes the answer is an unambiguous no
7654,it is always laborious to find@ the components@ of a vector so we are not much better off with@ a than with@ h or b it turns out however that a is a more basic quantity@ of physics than b since b is given@ bythe curl@ of a it is possible that a is finite while its curl@ is zero
7655,interestingly under@ these@ conditions a has@ an effect on@ certain quantum-mechanical phenomena
7656,it would be unfair both to@ the vector potential@ and to@ quantummechanicsto say@ that none of those@ formulations@ have@ engineering applications@ in@ fact the most sensitive@ magnetometer built to@ date is based@ on@ that@ kind of theory but by and large engineers wouldn't lose@ much sleep if the useof a were banned@ with@ immediate@ effect@ 
7657,the vector potential@ is not a popular@ variable among@ engineers maybe because it is not directly@ measurable
7658,there are no instruments capable@ to measure the magnitude or direction of a
7659,in@ my opinion a is a useful thing if used with@ moderation
7660,it helped@ us to derive@ biot-savart's law@ it will come@ handy@ later in@ solving certain radiation problems and it often leads@ to@ nice@ formulae@ eg for the magnetic flux@ crossing a surface defined as [formula]@ that may be rewritten in terms of the vector potential@ as follows@ [formula]@ where@ c is the curve enclosing the surface
7661,we have now collected a good@ number of formulae@ which will serve@ us well in@ the following@ sections@ 
7662,before@ going@ on@ just a few words about@ the classification of steady@ currents@ 
7663,it may be roughly@ divided@ into@ two parts@ magnetostatics and the rest
7664,we shall discuss the rest first sections@ ## and that@ will give@ us some idea of the relative significance@ of electric and magnetic fields@ 
7665,sections@ ## are concerned@ with@ magnetostatics where@ electric fields@ are assumed@ to be zero and the interrelationship of j h and b are studied@ 
7666,since we have@ so many variables and since in@ each physical configuration only some of them appear@ we will record just for this@ chapter the non-zero variables in@ each section@ heading 
7667,#
7668,the defocusing of an electron beam@ j e d p h b
7669,we have so far@ talked about@ positive@ and negative@ charges@ about@ point@ charges@ and distributed charge@ 
7670,i shall now introduce@ the concept of an elementary charge@ #  # c carried@ byan elementary particle called@ the electron
7671,this@ is not a necessity
7672,it is possible to study@ electromagnetic theory without@ ever mentioning the word electron but since it has become such a household@ word and is used so often we can just as well make@ use of it
7673,in@ the present@ section@ we shall consider@ a cylindrical electron beam@ of radius a in which the charge@ density@ is uniform p = po and all electrons travel@ with@ velocity v
7674,we are not going@ to enquire into@ the details how such beams@ can be produced it belongs to@ the subject@ of physical electronics we shall acceptthe fact that the beam@ exists and will try to work out the forces@ on@ the outermost electrons
7675,there is now cylindrical symmetry and a net charge@ per unit length [formula]@ yielding@ for the radial component@ of the electric field@ [formula]@ 
7676,the magnetic field@ may be obtained@ from@ ampre's law@ eqn # as follows@ [formula]@ where@ the line@ integral is taken@ over@ the circle of radius a fig # i is the total current@ of the beam@ and [formula]@ is the azimuthal component@ of the magnetic field@ in@ the cylindrical coordinate system specified@ by[formula]@ 
7677,from@ eqn # we get@ [formula]@ 
7678,the electric force@ on@ an electron of charge@ e travelling@ at the edge of the beam@ r = a is it is in@ the radial direction pointing@ outwards
7679,the magnetic force@ is perpendicular both to@ the direction of motion +z axis and the direction of magnetic field@ [formula]@ direction
7680,the vectorial product@ v x b gives@ an inward force@ in@ the radial direction
7681,hence the net force@ on@ the electron is [formula]@ 
7682,noting that [formula]@ and anticipating the relationship [formula]@ to be derived@ in@ section@ # we get@ the following@ formula@ for the force@ [formula]@ where@ c is the velocity of light
7683,it may be seen@ from@ the above@ equation that the magnetic force@ is negligible in comparison with the electric force@ unless the velocity of the electron approaches@ the velocity of light
7684,thus the conclusion is that owing to the repulsive forces@ between the electrons a cylindrical electron beam@ is unstable@ 
7685,usinga technical@ term@ borrowed@ from@ electron optics we could say@ that the electron beam@ gets defocused
7686,the other conclusion as far@ as it is permissible to generalize from@ a single example is more important in@ principle
7687,it is concerned@ with@ the relative magnitudes of electric and magnetic forces@ 
7688,since charged@ particles rarely travel@ close@ to@ the velocity of light we may conclude that the magnetic forces@ are byorders of magnitude smaller@ than the electric forces@ 
7689,why is it then@ that we have@ no difficulties in@ practice in@ observing magnetic fields@ 
7690,the reason is of course that there are two kinds of electric charges@ and their effect usually cancels@ so the small magnetic field@ has@ a chance of getting observed
7691,and that@ brings@ us to@ the ext example 
7692,# pinch@ effect j h b
7693,in@ contrast@ to@ our previous example we shall now investigate@ a cylindrical beam@ consisting of two kinds of charge@ carriers@ negative@ electrons and some positive@ particles which i do not wish to be more precise about@ at@ the moment
7694,we shall assume@ that the two kinds of particles have@ equal densities@ and move in@ opposite@ directions
7695,as a result there is no net space charge@ and hence no electric field@ 
7696,the currents@ on@ the other hand@ do not cancel@ because they represent opposite@ charges@ moving in opposite@ directions remember minus one times minus one is equal to@ plus one
7697,the magnetic field@ strength@ is given@ again byeqn # we only need to substitute@ for the current@ in + ip where@ the subscripts n and p refer@ to@ negative@ and positive@ particles respectively
7698,hence the magnetic force@ on@ the electron at the edge of the beam@ at r = a is [formula]@ and on@ the positive@ particle is [formula]@ 
7699,note that the force@ is inwards and in@ the same direction for both particles
7700,let us distinguish two cases 
7701,both particles are mobile
7702,in@ that@ case both of them will move inwards under@ the effect of magnetic force@ 
7703,but if the diameter of the beam@ is reduced eqns # and # tell@ us that the forces@ are even larger@ 
7704,what happens then@ 
7705,if everything was uniform then@ the beam@ diameter would go@ on@ decreasing
7706,in@ practice however the beam@ is not uniform and does not possess@ perfect cylindrical symmetry
7707,under@ these@ conditions the motion of the particles is fairly complicated and of course our model is unable to predict@ the detailed behaviour@ of the particles
7708,nevertheless a few qualitative conclusions may be drawn@ without@ doing any further@ mathematics
7709,if the cross-section happens to be smaller at a certain place then@ the forces@ are larger@ there than at the neighbouring cross-sections so the beam@ will be further@ constricted etc leading@ to@ the sausage@ instability fig #a
7710,if the magnetic field@ happens to be larger at one side than at the other side then@ the beam@ will be deflected towards the weaker@ field@ which makes@ the field@ even weaker@ etc leading@ to@ the kink@ instability fig #b 
7711,the positive@ particle is immobile
7712,in@ practice this@ means that the positive@ ions are part of the crystal lattice@ 
7713,there is then@ no magnetic force@ on@ the ions only on@ the electrons
7714,so the electrons want@ to move inwards but cannot because the ions hold@ them back@ byvirtue@ of their electrostatic attraction
7715,naturally if the ions attract the electrons the converse is true as well ie owing to the magnetic force@ on@ the electrons there is also an inward force@ upon@ the ions
7716,so the whole crystal structure tries@ to contract or in@ other words the material is under@ pressure see example #
7717,in@ any practical situation this@ pressure is small@ and can be neglected when calculating the forces@ on@ current-@ carrying@ conductors@ 
7718,#
7719,flow@ patterns@ and ohm's law@ j e d
7720,up to@ now we have not enquired into@ the question of how the current@ arose@ 
7721,we just assumed@ that certain charge@ carriers@ moved with@ certain velocities
7722,now we shall say@ that in@ a class of materials the current@ density@ at any point is proportional to@ the electric field@ in@ mathematical form@ [formula]@ where@ [formula]@ is the conductivity of the material
7723,the above@ equation is spite of its utmost simplicity represents an extremely good@ guess
7724,it is valid for nearly all materials up to@ quite high@ electric fields@ 
7725,will there be a magnetic field@ 
7726,yes of course whenever there is a current@ there is a magnetic field@ as well
7727,but the effect of the magnetic field@ upon@ the motion of the electrons is nearly always negligible one exception causing the pinch@ effect is mentioned in@ the previous section@ 
7728,thus we may safely@ ignore the magnetic field@ when determining@ the lines@ of current@ flow@ 
7729,we are then@ left@ with@ only one equation [formula]@ or [formula]@ or [formula]@ depending on our preference
7730,eqn # tells@ us that there is some analogy see example # with@ the electrostatic case treatedin@ chapter #
7731,we may in@ fact reinterpret any of the diagrams of figs # -# byassuming@ that the whole space is filled with@ a material of conductivity [formula]@ and the field@ lines@ are now the lines@ of current@ flow@ as well
7732,is the analogy perfect
7733,not really because # as current@ flows@ there is some potential@ drop@ in the electrode itself # zero conductivity for part@ of the space cannot be electrostatically modelled since there are no dielectrics with@ er = # and # when current@ flows@ through two materials of different conductivity there is generally a surface charge@ at the boundary see example #
7734,it is not worth@ discussing any of these@ complications because one is rarely called@ upon@ to work out lines@ of current@ in a conductor@ 
7735,we shall rather return@ to@ a very simple@ geometrical configuration for deriving@ ohm's law@ 
7736,we shall take a piece of cylindrical material of length l and cross-section s and apply@ a voltage between the ends
7737,the electric field@ is then@ [formula]@ the current@ density@ [formula]@ and the current@ [formula]@ 
7738,from@ circuit@ theory [formula]@ where@ r is the resistance@ of the material
7739,comparing eqns # and # we get@ [formula]@ 
7740,since [formula]@ is bydefinition the resistivity we get@ the result you learned in@ school that the electrical resistance@ is proportional to@ the resistivity and the length of the sample and inversely proportional to@ its cross-section
7741,a more general definition of resistance@ valid for varying cross-sections may be easily arrived@ at@ but it is hardly worth@ the trouble@ 
7742,the essential thing is that the relation [formula]@ is equivalent to@ ohm's law@ 
7743,risking@ the dismay of circuit@ engineers some theoreticians do in@ fact refer@ to@ eqn # as ohm's law@ 
7744,prologue
7745,post-impressionism royal academy of arts london #
7746,he signed the friends' book in@ his elegant handwriting alexander wedderburn january #nd #
7747,she had said peremptory as always that he was to go straight@ to room iii where the miraculous stuff was to be found
7748,early
7749,so here he was a distinguished public man also an artist of a kind stepping obediently through room i french # and room ii british # and # on@ a lead@ grey@ morning to the pale@ grey classical quiet@ place where the bright light shone and sang@ off@ pigment so that the phrase miraculous stuff seemed merely accurate@ 
7750,on one long wall hung a row of van goghs including an arles poets' garden he hadn't seen before@ but recognised from@ small photographs from charged descriptions in@ the painter's letters
7751,he sat down and saw a bifurcated path simmering@ with@ gold@ heat round and under the rising spreading@ blue-black-green down-pointing@ vanes@ of a great pine still widening where the frame interrupted its soaring@ 
7752,two decorous figures advanced hand-in-hand under its suspended thickness
7753,and beyond green grass and geraniums splashes@ of blood@ 
7754,alexander was not worried about@ whether frederica would turn up
7755,she was no longer in@ the habit@ of being late her life had schooled@ her to@ temporal accuracy perhaps to@ being considerate
7756,he himself at@ sixty-two felt@ not quite accurately@ that he was now too old too settled to be put@ out@ by her or by anyone else
7757,he thought with@ warmth@ of her certain approach@ 
7758,there had been a pattern@ an only too discernible repetition in@ the events and relationships of his life into@ which she had ruggedly@ refused to fit@ 
7759,she had been a nuisance a threat a torment and was now a friend
7760,she had suggested that they look at van gogh together setting@ up@ another form@ of repetition deliberate contrived and aesthetic
7761,his play the yellow chair had first been presented@ in@ # he did not like to think too closely@ about@ it as he did not like to think too closely@ about@ any of his past work
7762,he stared at the serenely impassioned garden made out of a whirlof yellow brushstrokes a viridian impasto a dense mass of furiously@ feathered@ lines@ of blue-green isolated black pot hooks the painfully@ clear@ orange-red spattering
7763,he had@ trouble finding@ an appropriate language for the painter's obsession with@ the illuminated@ material world@ 
7764,he would have been lying if he had recorded only the more accessible@ drama@ of the painter's electric@ quarrels with@ gauguin in the yellow house in arles the distant necessary brother who supplied paint and love the severed ear delivered to the whore in the brothel the asylum fears
7765,at first he had thought that he could write a plain@ exact verse with@ no figurative language in@ which a yellow chair was the thing itself a yellow chair as a round gold@ apple was an apple or a sunflower a sunflower
7766,sometimes he still saw@ the brushstrokes as it were in@ this@ naked@ way@ so that his earlier thoughts of this@ garden had to be undone@ the idea of black wings to be stripped@ from@ the painted leafage the vulgar idea of blood splashes washed@ off@ the notation of geraniums
7767,but it couldn't be done
7768,language was against@ him for a start@ 
7769,metaphor lay@ coiled@ in@ the name sunflower which not only turned towards but resembled the sun the source@ of light
7770,van gogh's idea of things@ had also been against@ him
7771,the yellow chair besides being brushstrokes and pigment besides being a yellow chair was one of twelve bought for a company of artists who were to inhabit the yellow house the white walls of which should blaze@ with@ sunflowers as the windows of gothic cathedrals blazed@ with@ coloured light
7772,not only metaphor cultural motif@ immanent religion a faith and a church
7773,one thing@ always linked@ to@ another thing@ 
7774,as the poets' garden a decoration for the bedroom of the poet gauguin was more than it seemed
7775,some time ago i read an article on@ dante petrarch boccaccio and botticelli
7776,good lord it did make@ an impression@ on@ me reading the letters of those@ men
7777,arles #
7778,and petrarch lived quite near here in avignon and i am seeing the same cypresses and oleanders
7779,there is still a great@ deal@ of greece all through the tartarin and daumier part of this@ queer@ country where the good folks have@ the accent you know there is a venus of arles just as there is a venus of lesbos and one still feels@ the youth@ of it in spite of all
7780,but isn't it true@ this garden has a fantastic@ character@ which makes@ you quite able to imagine the poets of the renaissance strolling among these bushes and over the flowery grass
7781,the youth@ of it alexander thought
7782,i thought i was world-weary then
7783,in@ july # two years after@ writing this@ van gogh had shot himself inefficiently in the groin and had died slowly
7784,in@ # alexander a time-obsessed man had read the centenary edition # of the letters
7785,he had himself been rising@ thirty-seven and when the yellow chair was put@ on@ had passed@ that@ age was older now than van gogh as he had in@ the # realised that he was older than keats
7786,he had felt@ perhaps briefly the power@ of the survivor@ 
7787,what nonsense
7788,the eternal youth@ of provence
7789,he thought of thick fat@ hot motorways carving@ up@ that@ land
7790,he turned@ his attention to@ the timeless fields of wheat and olives
7791,she made@ a kind of progress up the palladian marble stair
7792,a painter stopped to kiss her a journalist waved
7793,john house who had organised the exhibition came almost leaping down the stairs accompanied by a smallish woman in a pine-green tent@ coat
7794,he also kissed frederica and introduced the woman fumbling@ her name as a colleague and frederica as frederica you must forgive me i never know what name you re working under@ women these@ days are so protean
7795,frederica did not attempt to ascertain the fumbled@ name having given upinterest in@ stray@ new people until it was clear@ that they were of real concern
7796,she assumed@ wrongly that john house's colleague was an art historian
7797,the colleague looked at frederica with@ an apparently absent-minded scanning@ attention
7798,john house spoke of the history of the gathering@ of the images an emptiness here jacob wrestling the angel an unexpected illumination there 
7799,frederica listened attentively went on and signed the visitors' book
7800,frederica potter radio # critics' forum@ 
7801,she negotiated@ a free@ catalogue
7802,she made@ her leisurely way towards where she had told alexander to be
7803,an old woman armed@ with a sound guide@ became quite excited and pulled at the arm of another
7804, hey look at that winston churchill painted that the carefully cap d'antibes
7805,frederica dipped@ round her to stare claude monet au cap d'antibes par vent de mistral
7806,a whirl of blue and rose for in less formed plungings of water and wind
7807, to paint she remembered from proust's description of fictive elstir that one does not see what one sees
7808,to paint light and air between ourselves and objects
7809, i said dear winston churchill the second woman tugged free of the clutching@ fingers
7810, not to be mentioned in@ the same breath with@ she said looking nervously from frederica to painted signature
7811,the arrested@ water shone@ and danced@ 
7812,in@ the catalogue john house quoted monet's description of the painted light around the snowy haystacks an enveloping@ veil@ 
7813,he also quoted mallarm i think that there should be only allusion
7814,to name an object is to suppress@ three-quarters of the enjoyment of the poem which is created by the gradual@ pleasure of apprehending@ it
7815,to suggest@ it that@ is the dream@ 
7816,it was not a view@ of things@ with@ which frederica was entirely in@ sympathy she liked naming names
7817,but she looked briefly down dazzled@ by the flowing@ skin@ of worked and delicate@ colour the blue and rose tourbillons of the mistral on the sea the prismatically sliced@ frosty nimbus round the mysterious squat stacks
7818,she scribbled words notes in@ the margin of her catalogue
7819,daniel bought a ticket and paid for the hire of a catalogue he wasn't sure why
7820,he had come he believed because he needed to discuss certain administrative problems with@ frederica
7821,he was aware that she believed he was in need of art
7822,under his arm he carried a folded newspaper with that@ day's headline peace mother@ dies
7823,he was raw@ to@ bad news more raw@ as he grew older which was not perhaps quite what he had expected 
7824,he saw and did not see the paintings
7825,there was a field of poppies and corn which reminded@ him only of small and large faded@ and ghostly@ versions of van gogh's harvest which he had seen repeated@ in endless hospital corridors waiting rooms school offices
7826,he had seen these ample fields as he had seen cezanne's geometric brown and green undergrowth in more than one mental hospital day room
7827,odd@ he thought considering@ van gogh himself had died mad and despairing in such surroundings
7828,not serene overexcited@ these fields
7829,daniel's patience with@ the nervously ill was not what it had been
7830,although he was fourteen years younger than alexander daniel too was in@ the habit@ of thinking of himself a survivor@ a battered@ and grizzled@ survivor@ 
7831,alexander saw her coming towards him
7832,a dozen or so schoolgirls were dutifully filling in xeroxed hand-written one-word-answerable questionnaires
7833,alexander always a connoisseur of garments realised that frederica had changed@ her style that the clothes the young creatures were wearing could be described as a parody@ of the clothes frederica had worn at@ their age and that frederica's new style was not unrelated@ to@ this@ shift
7834,there she was in a conventional two-piece suit fine dark@ wool muted@ geometrical pattern in@ greens and unexpected straw browns caught@ in@ at the waist still very thin to give@ the effect of a bustle the skirt long and straight to the knee
7835,she had ruffles not swashbuckling at the neck and the small velvet hat could but did not support a veil
7836,the pale@ red hair was in a figure of eight chignon in her neck reminiscent of one of toulouse-lautrec's fine-drawn cafe habitues
7837,fifties and post-impressionist thought alexander connecting@ 
7838,she came@ up@ and kissed him
7839,he remarked on@ the parody@

7841, my dear i know

7861,they saw daniel advancing
7862, daniel doesn't change@ said alexander
7863, sometimes i wish he did said frederica
7864,daniel did not change@ 
7865,he wore the same black clothes baggy corduroys heavy sweater working-man's jacket that he had worn through@ the sixties and seventies
7866,like many hirsute men he had thinned a little on top where once his black fur@ had been extravagant but he had a plentiful and prickling black beard and his body was still compact and very heavy
7867,he looked in this@ setting a little some painter@ 
7868,he saluted frederica and alexander with his rolled newspaper and said that it was cold outside
7869,frederica kissed him too reflecting@ that he was dressed like a man who smelled dirty but in@ fact didn't
7870,alexander smelled still of old spice and a sort of agreeable toastiness
7871,his smooth brown hair was as thick as ever but shot@ now with@ needles@ of glittering@ silver@ 
7872, we must talk said daniel
7873, first you must look at the pictures

7880,gauguin's man with the axe
7881, one for you said frederica to@ alexander still skimming@ the necessary accompanying@ print
7882, androgynous
7883,john house says
7884,no gauguin said
7885,do you think
7886,alexander considered@ the decorative gold@ body itself a repetition of a body on the parthenon frieze
7887,he saw a blue loincloth flat breasts purple sea with coral tracings lying@ flatly on it
7888,he was unmoved though the colours were rich@ and strange
7889,he told frederica he preferred his androgynes to be more obscured@ more veiled@ more suggested and directed@ her attention to@ still-life fete gloanec # in@ which various inanimate objects two ripe pears a dense bunch of flowers swam@ across a bright@ red table-top rimmed with a black ellipse
7890,the picture was signed madeleine bernard and alexander told frederica that gauguin had flirted seriously with@ that@ young woman had characterised her as was fashionable at@ the time as having@ the desirable unattainable androgynous perfection complete sensuality combined@ with@ unattainable self-sufficiency
7891,frederica informed him from@ the catalogue that the vegetation was supposed to be a jocular portrait by gauguin of madeleine the pears@ her breasts@ the dense@ flowers@ her hair@ 
7892, you could read@ it another way@ said alexander interested now you could read@ the pears as androgynous@ in@ themselves as partly male@ 
7893, and the hair as other hair said frederica loudly scandalising a few bystanders amusing a few more
7894, you like to cork@ for your images don't you alexander
7895, it's age said alexander peaceably untruthfully
7896,they were beginning to attract@ a penumbra@ of gallery-goers as though they were offering a guided tour
7897,they moved on to the olive pickers
7898,daniel's mind was elsewhere@ 
7899,he remembered a straight mass of red-gold@ hair in cold king's chapel more golden@ than foxy@ frederica's slowly settling@ onto a collar as the pins released@ their grip@ 
7900,he saw@ a mass of freckles sometimes melding@ into@ sixpenny-sized brown patches of warmth@ moving@ over the hard@ frame@ of cheekbones and brow
7901,the sexless@ voices rose@ in the cold
7902, unto@ us a boy is born
7903, herod then with@ wrath was filled@ 
7904,the voices played@ with@ the slaughter@ of the innocents treble and descant hunting@ each other while she bowed her head unable to sing in@ tune
7905,the olives had been painted from@ the asylum at st rmy in@ #
7906,as for me i tell you as a friend i feel@ impotent when confronted@ with@ such nature for my northern brains were oppressed@ by a nightmare in those peaceful spots as i felt@ one ought to do better things@ with@ the foliage
7907,yet i did not want to leave@ things@ alone entirely without@ making@ an effort but it is restricted@ to@ the expression of two things the cypresses the olive trees let others who are better and more powerful@ than i reveal@ their symbolic language
7908,look@ here@ there is another question that comes@ to@ mind
7909,who are the human beings that actually live among the olive the orange the lemon orchards
7910,frederica and alexander held@ a discussion of natural supernaturalism
7911,daniel looked at the pink sky the twisted trunks the silvery leaves the rhythmic@ earth streaked with yellow ochre with pink with pale@ blue with red-brown
7912,olives frederica agreed with@ alexander could not recall@ the mount of olives the garden of gethsemane in@ the day of van gogh the pastor's son the lay preacher
7913,as the cypresses must always differently mean@ death 
7914,daniel asked for politeness really why van gogh had been mad was it just that he was driven
7915,alexander said that it may have been a form@ of epilepsy exacerbated by the atmospheric-electric disturbances of the mistral and the heat
7916,or you could make@ a freudian explanation
7917,he felt@ guilty towards@ the child who had not survived for whom he had been named
7918,he had been born on@ march #th #
7919,his dead brother vincent van gogh had been born on@ march #th #
7920,he was in@ flight@ from@ his family his dead alter ego his uncertain sense@ of identity
7921,he wrote to@ theo i hope you are not a van gogh
7922,essentially i am not a van gogh
7923,i have always looked@ upon@ you as theo daniel said he could not see@ the pain@ frederica said was in@ the olives and alexander still lecturing said that vincent had objected to@ paintings of symbolic christs in gethsemane by bernard and his compres had torn up his own had made@ do@ with@ the olives themselves
7924,he told daniel about@ the terrible st rmy painting of the blasted tree about@ noir-rouge and daniel said that it was odd@ that these@ orchards should be all over the walls of other asylums now to cheer people up
7925,the trees stood@ under their haloes of pink and green strokes small flying@ things solidified light movements or saccades of the eye brushstrokes pigment
7926,here@ is a description of a canvas which is in front of me at@ the moment
7927,a view of the park of the asylum where i am staying onthe right a grey terrace and a side wall of the house
7928,some deflowered rose bushes on the left a stretch@ of the park red-ochre the soil scorched by the sun covered with fallen pine needles 
7929,this@ edge of the park is planted with large pine-trees whose trunks and branches are red-ochre the foliage green gloomed over by an admixture of black
7930,these@ high trees stand out against@ an evening sky with violet stripes on a yellow ground which higher up turns@ into@ pink into@ green
7931,a wall also red-ochre shuts@ off@ the view and is topped only by a violet and yellow-ochre hill
7932,now the nearest tree is an enormous trunk struck@ by lightning and sawed-off
7933,but one side branch shoots up very high and lets fall an avalanche@ of dark@ green pine needles 
7934,this@ sombre@ giant@ a defeated@ proud@ man@ contrasts when considered@ in@ the nature@ of a living creature with@ the pale@ smile@ of a last rose on the fading bush in front of him
7935,to@ emile barnard st rmy december #
7936,you will realise that this@ combination of red-ochre of green gloomed over by grey the black streaks surrounding the contours produces@ something of the sensation@ of anguish called noir-rouge from@ which certain of my companions in@ misfortune frequently suffer
7937,i am telling you about@ this@ to remind you that one can try to give@ an impression@ of anguish without@ aiming@ straight@ at@ the historic garden of gethsemane
7938,daniel thought about@ dead ann maguire who like anna van gogh the dutch pastor's wife had named a younger hopeful child for a dead one
7939,though in@ van gogh's case the names theodorus vincent vincent theodorus appeared@ and reappeared@ from@ generation to@ generation the cultural parallels@ to@ certain persisting@ aspects of the family face a heavy@ brow an intense blue eye a cheek bone a nostril
7940,in the churchyard in his last parish a family in@ the english # had tried@ to name@ a son walter cornelius brittain and had buried@ three aged five aged two aged one month interspersed by variegated@ dead daughters a jennet a marian an eva
7941,in@ august # a car containing an ira gunman possibly already dead ploughed@ onto a pavement and killed@ three of mrs maguire's children joanne eight john two andrew six weeks leaving@ one son mark aged seven
7942,people had been shocked by numbers as well as by gratuitous death itself as people will be and mrs maguire's sister and a friend had founded the peace people whose brave@ beginning and sad@ end@ will not be chronicled here@ 
7943,ann maguire had borne a second joanne in new zealand from where she had returned unable to bear@ cultural transplantation@ 
7944,although the papers referred@ to@ her as the peace mother she had not been active in@ the peace people
7945,she had brought@ a case for legal compensation for her dead children's lives and for her own suffering and one of her few recorded public utterances was to call the first offer of compensation pitiful
7946,the day of the hearing of her second case she had been found dead
7947,daniel had pieced@ the story together@ from@ the radio with throat wounds
7948,foul@ play was not suspected and from@ conflicting newspapers
7949, with hedge-cutters
7950, with a carving knife
7951, with an electric carving-knife by her side
7952,her motives the coroner was to say were not completely easy to understand
7953,daniel who had become a specialist in@ wild@ blows@ of chance thought he understood some of it
7954,he had not prayed for ann maguire
7955,he was not that kind of priest
7956,he had metaphorically shaken@ a large@ fist@ impotently at@ some looming@ energy-field@ and got on with his work his work
7957,he followed the other two into the dark shadows of the room housing@ the low countries
7958,nuns ascended and descended a cool@ grey stair in winged@ white caps
7959,the lauriergracht in amsterdam was gloomed and glittering
7960,mondriaan's evening was sombre@ and cloudy
7961,he liked these@ 
7962,like vincent although he was unaware that vincent had remarked on@ it he had northern brains and responded@ biologically and spiritually to@ tones@ of black donkey-brown varied greys touches of white in dark@ 
7963, one of the most beautiful things@ done by the painters of this@ country has been the painting of black which nevertheless has light@ in@ it vincent had written from holland
7964,xavier mellery the painter of the nuns was described in@ the catalogue as creating a light which is the negation@ of that@ which envelops@ our immediate visual experience of things@ it is rather the interior light@ of your mind
7965,daniel was used to@ such language it was his daily or anyway weekly pabulum@ 
7966,he knew about@ the light@ shining@ in@ darkness@ and had come@ for reasons completely different from@ alexander's desire for exactness specificity to mistrust figurative language
7967,he never now made@ a sermon from@ a metaphor nor drew@ analogies he preached examples cases lessons
7968,but he liked the black dutch paintings they were so to speak on@ his wavelength@ 
7969,he cornered@ frederica
7970, you said you'd@ news of will
7971, a postcard yes
7972, where this@ time
7973, kenya
7974,on the way to the ugandan famine i think
7975, hippie said daniel
7976, helping out said frederica
7977, what use comparatively is a chap like that@ wi'@ no training@ no medical no
7978,another mouth to feed
7979,it makes@ me wild@ 
7980, i think he is often useful in@ his way@ 
7981,you judge@ him so he judges@ me
7982,judging@ runs@ in@ the family
7983, it does said frederica
7984, once said daniel i was in charing cross hospital someone's kid had taken an overdose and died they pump them out there regular clockwork@ but this@ one's liver couldn't take@ any more
7985,anyway there i was going up@ this@ endless corridor thinking what to do about@ the mother who blamed herself wi'@ reason mind you she was one of those@ soft@ suckering witch-@ but that@ made@ it worse not better and there was th' trolley wi' the dead girl on it sliding by me sheet right over porters in those@ soft theatre boots and floppy plastic bathcaps and when they'd got past me and were turning in't door the first one looked at me from under his plastic frills with@ my own face@ 
7986,i was shocked for a minute
7987,got all his hair tucked up in that@ thing you see@ otherwise he's not so like me not strikingly so
7988, hi he said
7989, going@ about@ your father's business are you
7990,so i asked him what he was up to@ and he said he was going to and fro in the earth and walking up@ and down@ in it and then he pushed th trolley in and i went in after and the mother began her howling@ and shrieking and will said well i'll walk off and leave you to@ it
7991,and i said where are you going then
7992,and he said i told you
7993,to and fro
7994,that@ was the last i saw of will
7995,the nuns ascended the stairs in@ a perpetual cool@ silence
7996, quoting scripture for his own purposes said daniel
7997, that@ was rather funny i thought said frederica
7998, anything on the postcard about@ coming back@ 
7999,any plans@ 
8000, no
8001,sometimes she wished will would not write to@ her at all if he would send no messages to@ daniel
8002,sometimes she told herself the postcards or exercise book scrawls were messages to@ daniel but one should never she considered@ ignore surface@ meanings in favour of implications and the damned things were addressed to@ her to@ frederica
8003, oh hell she said
8004, not to worry said daniel
8005, i'll push@ off@ 
8006,i'll see you
8007, you haven't seen the pictures
8008, i'm not in@ the mood
8009, we were going to have coffee in fortnum and mason's
8010, no thank you all the same
8011,wednesday # january #
8012,clare still swapped@ one night a week off@ with@ stephanie and reported subsequent events to@ gilda who now managed the shoe shop occasionally she visited clare for an evening meal
8013,as clare poured sherry gilda asked so how was the boac pilot
8014,tony was the worst yet
8015,clare never felt@ embarrassed discussing sex with@ gilda who could talk about@ little else
8016,he'd read all the sex manuals ever printed
8017,whipped@ a porn magazine out of his flight case after@ the first gin and tonic
8018,he was coldly@ determined to be a good lover
8019,for me that@ was a total turn-off@ 
8020,porn pictures are a turn-off@ to@ most women
8021,women like words not pictures gilda said as she sipped her drink
8022,but i'm starting to think that everything's a turn-off@ for you doll@ 
8023,you clearly can't have@ sex with fellas you ain't fond of
8024,i expect you need a chap you know well someone you feel@ comfortable@ with@ not these@ one-nighters
8025,she swallowed half the glass
8026,now me i'm the reverse@ 
8027,if i don't give@ a damn about@ em i ain't anxious and if i ain't anxious then i come@ easy
8028,she drained her glass
8029,when tony couldn't get@ me to climax@ he wanted to ask another girl over clare said
8030,he automatically@ assumed@ that i was a lesbian
8031, not what he meant gilda said
8032,lots@ of guys find@ it a turn-on to watch two women making@ love 
8033,how very odd@ 
8034,can you imagine a woman trying to get two men into bed so could watch them
8035,forget this@ guy said gilda
8036,i know what need clare someone you know and trust someone who won't make@ you feel@ anxious
8037,then you'll relax and it'll happen then you'll stop being one of them miserable nymphos who hop@ from@ man to@ man hoping for mr right the man who can satisfy her
8038,as gilda held out her glass to be refilled she added@ reflectively@ although you seem more lonely than horny@ 
8039,are you looking@ for sex or just someone to talk to@ 
8040,you ain't likely to pick@ up@ prince charming in a bar
8041,clare said i'm not looking@ for prince charming
8042,i don't want the disorder@ the pain@ the mess@ or the misery of being in@ love
8043,i just want a short-term relationship without@ responsibility
8044,gilda laughed
8045,so do these@ fellas you pick@ up@ 
8046,but i'm not convinced that@'s right for you
8047,need a secure@ situation@ with@ someone you can trust who you know will stick around because he loves you
8048,i'll tell you who you ought to fall@ in@ love with@ clare
8049,who
8050,yourself
8051,you clearly think that you're a piece@ of worthless@ rubbish@ and if i pick@ up@ those@ vibes then so do the blokes
8052,why not give@ sex a rest@ for a bit and pay@ a bit@ of attention to@ yourself
8053,you never want to make@ a man the centre@ of your existence
8054,that@ place@ is for you clare
8055,i am the centre@ of my existence clare sang chanting@ a psalm@ pitching@ her voice an octave lower@ as she pushed josh to her playgroup the next@ morning
8056,a man stood on the porch his hands in the pocket of his beige mackintosh
8057,good morning
8058,are you a prospective parent
8059,clare asked
8060,she felt in her pocket for the key 
8061,no said the man
8062,i'm an inspector for the local education authority
8063,after@ examining the bathroom the inspector pointed@ out@ that legally one toilet was required for every seven kiddies
8064,clare said but if each child goes there every two and a half@ hours one lavatory is adequate
8065,there is a potty for emergencies
8066,we have never had@ a problem
8067,the inspector was not listening
8068,he was making notes on@ other violations
8069,half@ an hour after the inspector left as if to prove his point@ the lavatory refused@ to flush
8070,the following@ morning clare's playgroup was ordered to close@ 
8071,two days later clare's mind was unexpectedly diverted@ from@ her personal problems no job no man when the cnd office telephoned@ to ask her for voluntary evening help they were organizing another protest after@ a nuclear accident
8072,over spain an american b-# bomber carrying@ an h-bomb had collided in mid-air with another aircraft
8073,the h-bomb with@ an explosive capacity of more than a million tons of tnt had fallen into the atlantic ocean off southern spain
8074,clare felt@ cheered@ to be back@ among@ like-minded people doing something worth while
8075,monday # february #
8076,valentine's day brought@ two happy@ events
8077,the radio reported@ that the missing h-bomb had been located on the atlantic seabed
8078,and to@ clare's delight she sold the lease of the apartment in which she ran@ her playgroup for a profit of twenty-three per cent
8079,clare felt@ as if she had won a sweepstake
8080,on@ the following@ morning she bought a portable tv a warm winter coat for herself and new clothes for josh
8081,she didn't buy any toys for josh because she had decided to open@ a toy shop
8082,two weeks later clare bought the short@ lease of a small shop in the pimlico road close to mrs gooden's home
8083,though there was a lot@ to do clare busy redecorating the shop and visiting wholesalers to buy stock still managed@ to work one evening a week for the movement
8084,in@ mid-april just before her toy shop opened@ clare's weary amiable national health doctor lookedupfrom his desk and said about@ your vaginal symptoms mrs shapiro
8085,you'd better go to st stephen's for tests they're properly equipped to handle@ this@ sort of thing@ 
8086,he seemed uneasy
8087,what sort of thing@ 
8088,not cancer
8089,no gonorrhoea the doctor said apologetically
8090,clare almost fainted from@ surprise and anxiety horror and shame
8091,then she wept
8092,the doctor refused to give her more sleeping tablets but scribbled a prescription for tranquillizers which were increasingly prescribed for women like clare with@ symptoms of anxiety in@ stressful situations@ such as poverty divorce or bereavement women with@ marital problems and women who were out of@ work also found@ them helpful@ although the pills did nothing to resolve the problem responsible@ for the initial anxiety
8093,clare who blushed with@ shame whenever she thought about@ it waited anxiously for the result of her tests at st stephen's hospital
8094,the tests were negative
8095,but within@ a month she couldn't get@ through@ the day without@ tranquillizers she felt@ less anxious calmer
8096,clare managed to open@ the red rocking horse by@ mid-may
8097,at@ the opening party an excited three-and-a-half@ josh rode the pretty antique red rocking horse in the shop window 
8098,monday # august #
8099,standing by the swimming pool at saracen miranda beckoned to@ adam who was floating on the water in a transparent blow-up plastic armchair
8100,in@ a voice of soft@ persuasion she said will you do something for me adam
8101,i'm going to learn to fly
8102,i want you to break@ the news gently to@ gran
8103,but you promised your grandmother to learn to fly adam objected
8104,it was a condition of her gift to@ you the ten thousand pounds capital to start kits
8105,i didn't say for ever
8106,i'll pay the money back@ to@ her
8107,miranda was defiant
8108,i've always wanted to fly
8109,i won't be held@ by a promise that was unfairly extracted@ from@ me before i legally became an adult
8110,and i get bored with@ nothing to do on@ holiday but lie in the sun
8111,when are you starting
8112,adam asked resigned
8113,this@ morning at the cannes flying school
8114,they have@ english instructors
8115,four hours of instruction a day for two weeks
8116,and of course this@ time of year it's perfect flying weather
8117,miranda was triumphant now
8118,i've already passed@ the two written exams
8119,did law and meteorology last easter and now i've finished navigation radiotelephony and technical that@ was the toughest@ 
8120,so that@'s why you're so pale
8121,three hours later two thousand feet above the mediterranean miranda alert and exultant sat next to her instructor at the controls of a trainer plane an ugly little single-engine rallye which her instructor described as efficient and forgiving@ you could do something wrong m a rallye without@ getting immediately punished@ for it
8122,flying was even better than she had hoped better than skiing better than driving a sports car
8123,as the rallye droned towards the lighthouse on the tip of cap camerat miranda felt@ she were breathing@ the air@ of the gods@ 
8124,gently they swooped turned and climbed@ in the azure sky
8125,after they reached@ two thousand feet the instructor showed her how to fly level he then encouraged her to experiment with the stick@ manoeuvring the plane m@ every direction
8126,miranda felt@ that the aircraft was an extension@ of her arms and her fingertips outspread in@ flight
8127,heading west on@ the return flight path the instructor said this@ is the first time i've flown with a pupil and haven't once needed to touch the controls
8128,miranda pushed@ home@ this@ advantage
8129,then can i land
8130,the instructor hesitated then said why not
8131,the girl was clearly a natural flyer
8132,after@ being given@ clearance@ to land miranda following@ her instructor's directions@ started her approach she throttled back to reduce@ speed and control@ her descent as she flew towards the threshold@ the point@ just before she intended to touch down
8133,the plane was now moving@ at@ not much above@ stalling speed
8134,as the rallye dropped to about@ thirty feet above the runway miranda throttled back completely and held the stick@ back
8135,the plane seemed to glide forward and land itself
8136,the undemonstrative miranda flung@ her arms around the instructor
8137,oh thank you
8138,thank you
8139,quite a smooth@ landing the instructor said approvingly he hesitated then warned next@ time be careful not to land too fast or you'll run@ out@ runway
8140,this@ woman was adventurous and ambitious such pilots did not live long
8141,he added@ pilots are the ones that survive
8142,a good pilot never takes@ a risk
8143,the opposite of a good businessman miranda said still on@ a high@ 
8144,a businessman has to take@ risks constantly and win sixty per cent of the time
8145,in the air that@ risk factor would kill@ you 
8146,nine hundred years earlier the great hall had been the hub@ of castle life wolfhounds ate on floors strewn with rushes servants slept on straw pallets thrown on the floor
8147,then the winter salon did not smell of lilies and expensive leather but of stale@ fat stinking human bodies and animal ordure
8148,elinor sometimes thought of all the love and the hatred the treachery and the killing that this@ hall had undoubtedly seen@ when strong men fought hand-to-hand to@ the death to protect their women and children
8149,now the winter salon at saracen where elinor waited for adam was not only the coolest but the most impressive room in the chteau
8150,high arched walls of pale@ honey-coloured stone were hung with bluish-green tapestries around the big stone fireplace where logs burned in@ winter stood@ sofas covered in the blues and greens of the tapestries here and there were lamps flowers books and piles of parlour games
8151,what's keeping@ adam
8152,elinor asked buzz who was adding up the scrabble score@ 
8153,you said three o'clock
8154,it's only two-thirty buzz said
8155,ninety-three for you two hundred and sixty-four for me
8156,that@'s not a bad score@ for you nell
8157,buzz never cheated to let elinor win she knew that elinor would immediately sense this@ and feel@ humiliated
8158,after@ an intensive rehabilitation programme of physiotherapy and speech therapy elinor appeared to have completely recovered from@ her stroke@ although she could no longer think of three things@ at once which buzz said was a mercy for the people who had to live with her
8159,elinor was sometimes at@ a loss@ for the right word or name and then became impatient with@ herself she was often frustrated because she couldn't move as swiftly as she did before@ 
8160,at@ times she was downhearted and wondered whether she would ever write another book
8161,when you want to write you'll write buzz would tell her then 
8162,now buzz grunted look what i tore out of the 
8163,she dug@ into her pocket unfolded a bit of newspaper and read sportsman jim clark today opened@ a splendidly equipped physical training college at larkwood in wiltshire formerly the family home of the o'dare family
8164,lady o'dare commented i wish them well
8165,i doubt that@ 
8166,elinor peered at the photograph of the new owner a motor-racing hero standing with her sister-in-law marjorie
8167,the doorbell sounded
8168,i'll go buzz said
8169,it's either adam or the postman
8170,buzz returned reading a postcard
8171,it's for you from sonia rushleigh
8172,whoops i mean bromley
8173,who'd have thought them two would marry
8174,she says the colonel's taken up petit point and miss hawkins is teaching him
8175,remember her the schoolmistress
8176,i do indeed said elinor
8177,frumpy sourpuss
8178,who's the letter from
8179,clare
8180,buzz held the envelope out to elinor
8181,elinor shook her head
8182,you open it
8183,it's marked personal
8184,i don't want to read it unless she apologizes
8185,buzz opened the letter and read it
8186,she shook her head
8187,it's just a friendly@ letter asking@ how you are
8188,but reading between@ the lines@ i think clare needs money
8189,if she took her poor@ child back to his father and gave@ her husband a second chance she wouldn't need money
8190,how about@ a bit@ of generosity
8191,buzz said
8192,you're a silly stubborn old woman
8193,and clare's just as stubborn and just as silly
8194,it wouldn't have hurt@ her to say she was sorry
8195,elinor looked anxious
8196,do you really think she's short@ of money buzz
8197,i wouldn't want her to have@ a rough@ time
8198,this@ remark was overheard by adam as in pale@ blue shirt and jeans he sauntered through the door
8199,he said elinor you allowed ample provision in@ the trust for helping clare if the trustees consider@ that help is needed
8200,i'll check on@ clare when i get back to london
8201,he put a pile of papers on a side table
8202,there's rather a lot@ of paperwork here things@ that you should be aware of
8203,we've had more paperwork not less since the trust took over buzz said tartly@ 
8204,and i tell you frankly that i can't follow@ it adam
8205,i thought the trustees were going to manage the business
8206,elinor shouldn't be made@ to wade@ though@ pages of paragraphs with@ no commas in@ em
8207,of course the trustees manage the business and they do it very well adam said
8208,and there's no reason for elinor to see any of this if it tires her
8209,in@ fact i'm about@ to suggest something that would simplify matters
8210,what's that@ 
8211,buzz asked
8212,i'd like to substitute paul littlejohn for myself in@ the power@ of attorney that i hold@ on@ your behalf elinor
8213,i'm trying to reduce@ the number of business administrators the fewer there are the simpler the system@ and the cheaper it will be
8214,does that@ mean@ that paul will be legally responsible for elinor's affairs instead of you adam
8215,yes but that@'s only a technicality
8216,paul will do as i say
8217,and i'd also like you to sign this document adam added@ which absolves@ me and stg from@ any further responsibility once paul littlejohn has been substituted
8218,buzz said but surely
8219,smoothly@ adam explained the responsibility must clearly rest@ m@ only one area@ 
8220,it's in@ your interests to clarify@ the situation@ 
8221,it's customary
8222,if you think that@'s best adam dear
8223,elinor frowned slightly at@ buzz
8224,adam decided to hold@ back@ miranda's bombshell until later after elinor drank her evening glass of champagne 
8225,just before@ five o'clock when the business session had ended and the afternoon was still hot quiet@ and heavy@ with@ languor buzz left to get some tea
8226,adam escorted elinor to the elevator after@ taking her to her bedroom he intended to go to the beach for a swim
8227,in the high-ceilinged kitchen surrounded by the smells of mint and basil buzz whistled roses of picardy with@ much dramatic@ warbling@ as she prepared elinor's tea
8228,leaves and yellow blossoms obscured the top of the window while the bottom was covered by aggressive@ pink hollyhocks seemingly determined@ to fight@ their way@ inside
8229,sylvie the cook sat at the big kitchen table by the window writing a list and shooing pigeons away
8230,the bane of sylvie's life was the pigeon droppings that littered the windowsill and had to be cleaned up daily
8231,with@ a shudder sylvie refused a cup of tea
8232,still whistling buzz laid the tray
8233,the soporific calm@ of the drowsy@ afternoon was shattered@ by the bell indicator above the kitchen door
8234,someone was jabbing the bell non-stop in elinor's bedroom
8235,knowing that adam was probably in the elevator on his way to the beach buzz hurled herself out of the kitchen and ran upstairs
8236,frantically she tore@ open the door to elinor's apartment
8237,in the passage she stumbled and almost fell then flung back the door to the bedroom
8238,to@ her relief@ elinor was not slumped on the floor deathly white she clung for support to the silver brocade hangings of her bed
8239,wordlessly she pointed above the fireplace
8240,buzz turned her head to the left where the portrait of the three sisters hung
8241,at first buzz saw nothing but then she gasped in@ horror 
8242,each of the three long creamy@ necks had been cut horizontally a small triangle of canvas hung downward from each slashed throat 
8243,#
8244,wednesday # august #
8245,in the foyer of the clanrickard club mike grant leaned against the wall at the bottom of a double-sided curving staircase
8246,with@ his hands in the pockets of his dinner jacket he surveyed@ the room
8247,it was going to be a good night in spite of the fact that it was august and a wednesday
8248,making@ sure to appear casual he carefully watched the men in dinner jackets and the women in full-length dresses move slowly over the red carpet towards the restaurant at the rear or climb the staircase to the gaming rooms
8249,mike noticed a group of heavy@ gamblers most of them greek move towards the baccarat room where the sultan of rupolei had been losing for the last hour
8250,his attention was also caught@ by a woman dressed in midnight-blue satin and diamonds the sister of a middle-eastern ruler@ she was known as an audacious gambler
8251,he stiffened as he recognized a man move upstairs with@ a distinctive boneless@ saunter he had better send someone up to check the backgammon room
8252,the club owners the casinos and the multinational bookmakers knew@ which professional gamblers successfully played games that contained@ an element@ of skill such as backgammon and pokerand they preferred to have@ nothing to do with@ them ideally the house welcomed@ inexperienced rich idiots
8253,this@ is certainly a good night to play the odds
8254,mike heard a sarcastic voice from behind him
8255,he turned and smiled at@ adam
8256,come into my office for a drink
8257,what's up@ 
8258,in mike's office furnished with heavily varnished victorian club furniture
8259,adam shook his head curtly at@ the offer of a chair
8260,i'm not staying he said
8261,i merely wanted to tell you that you've scared the hell@ out of@ everyone at saracen except me
8262,so kindly curb your theatrical@ james bond streak@ 
8263,i knew immediately what your message meant@ if you don't pay up one slash is all it takes@ 
8264,he glared@ at@ his brother
8265,i thought you were fond of elinor
8266,i seem to recall@ that elinor helped you to buy your first good bike
8267,why drag@ her into@ my problems
8268,you might have given@ her another stroke@ 
8269,i don't know what the hell@ you're talking about@ and i can't comment until i do
8270,mike his face alert@ and wary@ lit a cigarette
8271,adam briefly described how the triple portrait had been slashed and added@ d'you really expect me to believe that you had@ nothing to do with@ it
8272,told some cat burglar where to find that@ picture
8273,mike stared at his brother then slowly said not me
8274,i agree it's clearly a warning to pay but i swear i know nothing about@ it
8275,it couldn't have been the brothers they'd be even less subtle
8276,he inhaled deeply
8277,who else do you owe money adam you stupid bastard@ 
8278,no one who'd do anything so bloody childish
8279,how do i stop this@ bloody@ nonsense
8280,how many times must i tell you that if you let@ things@ go@ too far@ nobody can stop what will undoubtedly happen
8281,adam mike went@ on@ quietly you've always taken@ full@ advantage of anyone who's fond of you
8282,you think you can push me around because you've been doing that@ since we were in@ the nursery
8283,you also grew up watching grandfather's clients literally get@ away@ with@ murder
8284,he sucked on his cigarette furiously threw it into the fireplace shoved his hands in his pockets and glared@ at@ adam
8285,do you to be found washed up on the seashore with@ a few vital bits missing
8286,are you so anxious to know what it feels like to have@ both eyeballs gouged out one at@ a time
8287,do you want to be slowly battered to@ death before@ dying in@ agony
8288,of course not you bastard@ adam said
8289,i only want to know who slashed that@ picture if you didn't
8290,whoever they are and only you know that@ these@ people are serious
8291,punters often try to avoid@ paying
8292,examples often have to be made@ 
8293,you know that@ 
8294,mike started to stride up@ and down@ the room
8295,take@ that@ fucking urbane look off@ your face and face@ reality adam
8296,if you lose@ money that@'s tough@ 
8297,but if you don't pay up that@'s insanity
8298,i've had@ enough of your melodrama@ adam snarled@ 
8299,mike glared@ at@ his brother again
8300,i'm not exaggerating
8301,remember that@ incident when the sultan's sister had her rolls stopped at@ two in@ the morning on the grande corniche after@ leaving the casino
8302,they blew@ away the chauffeur's head with a machine gun
8303,wasn't touched
8304,she paid all her gambling debts the very next@ day
8305,and when the story was carefully leaked@ to@ the newspapers quite a lot@ of other debts were suddenly settled@ in full
8306,i'm not some goddamned sultan's sister
8307,no but you also like playing@ with@ fire@ 
8308,you never believe that the gods will really let it burn@ 
8309,you think you're omnipotent but you aren't
8310,keep@ your voice down@ adam growled@ 
8311,i'll do what i bloody well like in my own office mike said
8312,don't you understand
8313,i'm on@ your side@ adam
8314,you're the only brother i have@ 
8315,his voice deepened@ 
8316,i'm probably more worried about@ this@ than you are
8317,if anything happened to@ you
8318,i'd be left@ without@ you
8319,so for god's sake pay up you stupid shit@ 
8320,don't think you can get@ away@ with@ it just because you've always got@ away@ with@ everything since you set@ that@ nursemaid's apron alight 
8321,i thought you were too young to remember that@ adam said uneasily
8322,he added@ she shouldn't have left the matches within reach of a child
8323,she was in hospital for six weeks and i was the only one who knew it wasn't an accident
8324,i knew you wanted to see@ 
8325,let's not argue about@ something that happened over@ thirty years ago adam said finally
8326,can you raise@ money to help me fend them off
8327,i promise you
8328,within@ six months i i'll have@ no more money problems
8329,never again
8330,you'll have@ money problems as long as you gamble adam
8331,annabel was determined to get@ a grip@ on@ herself and do as scott advised remember # as the year she stopped having to go to auditions and # as the year in@ which she blossomed@ into@ a successful young new york hostess as she met andy warhol lenny bernstein baby jane holzer and all the other gossip-columnist fodder@ 
8332,by@ july annabel was a junior friend of the metropolitan museum a friend of the museum of modern art and a patron of the bronx zoo
8333,she also allayed her insecurity with@ a massive@ spending spree each charity dinner required a new ballgown and each new glittering@ friend contacts@ for scott required a glittering@ party
8334,so the year thus far@ was a busy one
8335,the long@ road@ home@ 
8336,cia hq@ langley
8337,sorge had never been to langley before
8338,it was not something a russian expected to do
8339,it was after@ # am when nowak drove him through the gates past the guards and into the vast underground car-park
8340,why langley
8341,sorge had asked him on the way out of washington
8342,they want to show@ you that they trust you
8343,i don't expect i'll see much
8344,nowak laughed
8345,damn right
8346,we park in the underground car-park catch@ a special lift to the fifth floor and walk across the corridor into a special conference room
8347,that@'s trust
8348,that@'s trust
8349,the executive director was already in the meeting room
8350,welcome to langley
8351,he held his hand out in@ welcome
8352,when the introductions were complete the exec director the dda the ddi sorge and nowak settled themselves round the small conference table
8353,we have@ a new@ problem kicked@ off@ the exec director
8354,the english operative who was guarding trimmler has taken off
8355,he's also taken an agent of ours with him
8356,as hostage
8357,a woman
8358,we believe they're still in new orleans
8359,why asked sorge concerned
8360,i don't know yet
8361,what about@ goodenache
8362,he decided to turn@ the pressure@ on@ the russian
8363,he caught@ a flight to frankfurt
8364,he hired a car but the car was found abandoned on the outskirts of frankfurt
8365,we are trying to find our missing scientist now
8366,are the german authorities involved@ 
8367,no
8368,we have@ our own means@ 
8369,sorge saw the exec director look up his eyebrows raised@ suddenly
8370,we both have@ our methods
8371,even in an independent germany
8372,after@ all it was the death of our people in@ these@ situations@ that has brought@ us together
8373,the exec director shrugged
8374,bastard@ russians were still up@ to@ their old@ tricks@ 
8375,he ignored the pointed@ look the ddi was giving@ him
8376,i thought it best if the director of our operationsin new orleans gave@ you a run down of what has taken@ place@ up to now
8377,he sat back and let the dda give@ a full@ report includingthe trip@ to the voodoo ceremony and all that followed@ 
8378,sorge didn't stir even when they mentioned the gruesome spectacle of trimmler's arms folded@ in@ the sign of a swastika
8379,we still aren't convinced that trimmler's death has@ anything to do@ with@ the death of our agents
8380,there's no definite link@ 
8381,the situation@ might be clearer@ when i've finished
8382,sorge looked round the table saw their undisguised curiosity
8383,in@ # in germany we had@ a gru network@ named the 
8384,what's that@ asked the exec director
8385,red orchestra@ 
8386,the nazis called it that@ because we had@ radio operators we code-named musicians
8387,their leader the chef we called him was leopold trepper
8388,it was this@ group that radioed the warning of operation blue the attack on stalingrad that led@ to@ hitler's biggest@ wartime disaster on@ the russian front@ 
8389,who was feeding@ you all this@ information in germany asked the exec director
8390,high-ranking officials
8391,both in@ the military and in@ the government
8392,they saw@ the damage@ hitler was doing
8393,they didn't disagree with@ his aims@ only his methods
8394,when they saw@ that the war could not be won even as early as # some of them opened@ up@ lines@ of communication with@ us and the british
8395,we didn't get@ that@ sort of stuff@ till@ late into@ # said the dda
8396,you weren't europeans
8397,we had@ centuries of contacts@ to fall back on
8398,for all their bravery and resourcefulness their information was often wasted because stalin didn't believe them
8399,but then he found@ it difficult to believe anyone
8400,the germans with more sophisticated@ radio-tracking equipment started to track down the musicians@ 
8401,even trepper was captured and the was wound up at@ the end@ of #
8402,our information continued for a while but it was of doubtful@ origin
8403,trepper was interrogated bythe gestapo and we believed he became a double@ agent a lot@ of misinformation was received in moscow
8404,sorge leant across and finished his coffee before@ continuing
8405,but we still needed information
8406,the overall network@ with@ sources@ inside germany was the 
8407,the red what said the exec director pleased that he had deciphered the first word of the new@ code-name
8408,three
8409,the redthree
8410,based in switzerland and named after@ the three transmitters that they used
8411,the most important source@ of information from@ agents inside germany was from@ a group under@ rudolf roessler
8412,his code-name was lucy@ and his network@ the lucy@ ring@ 
8413,roessler or lucy was a swiss intelligence officer of german extraction
8414,he had@ many contacts@ in germany
8415,lucy's four main@ contacts@ were major general oster who was the head@ of the abwehr admiral canaris who was later hanged for his part@ in@ the # bomb plot@ carl goehdeler who was leader of the official opposition to@ hitler and colonel boetzel the commanding officer of intelligence evaluation
8416,there were others but lucy never disclosed@ any of them to@ us
8417,even after@ the war asked the ddi
8418,the lucy ring was disbanded in@ # after@ being responsible@ for some invaluable work
8419,i won't go@ through@ all their successes but it was substantial@ 
8420,the british were involved with@ them through@ us and it was their advanced work on@ breaking@ cyphers that enabled the ring@ to establish such a great@ record
8421,but the ring disbanded once more because of stalin's penchant for secrecy after moscow tried@ to bypass@ roessler and go@ direct@ to@ his number two 
8422,so where@'s the link@ interrupted the dda impatient as ever
8423,it's important you understand the background@ said sorge not allowing the american to get@ under@ his skin@ 
8424,nothing further@ came@ from@ the ring until@ the last few weeks of the war
8425,with@ the allies advancing on@ the eastern and western fronts@ many high-ranking germans were out@ to save their own necks
8426,the lucy ring was reactivated this@ time without@ the knowledge of the british
8427,or the americans commented the exec director
8428,i suggest you take@ that@ up@ with@ comrade stalin replied sorge drily
8429,it was an impressive list@ 
8430,they didn't just have@ knowledge
8431,they also had wealth
8432,in@ all forms@ 
8433,art cash in@ every form@ possible
8434,they used the ringbecause of their line@ into@ switzerland
8435,they wanted the security of the swiss banksand the russian bear@ 
8436,one was dependent on@ the other
8437,so they bought@ immunity@ 
8438,while our boys were still getting killed snapped@ the ddi
8439,as were ours snapped@ back@ sorge
8440,but your hands@ weren't that@ clean@ 
8441,you were bringing scientists and others into america just as we were
8442,scientists with@ nazi records scientists with@ a history of brutality war criminals
8443,gentlemen please said nowak ever the diplomat
8444,can we just stick@ to@ what we're here to discuss
8445,go@ on@ dimitri
8446,sorge was annoyed with@ himself irritated@ that he had allowed the intelligence man to get@ under@ his skin@ 
8447,of course he smiled back@ 
8448,now ah yes we used the lucy ring
8449,many germans withtheir prizes crossed safely into switzerland
8450,they came in cars army lorries even an aeroplane
8451,their riches were stored in the banks under@ private accounts and then they were brought through czechoslovakia and east germany into the soviet union
8452,all of them asked the dda
8453,those@ who broke@ their word were hunted down
8454,and disposed of 
8455,some needed reminding that we expected them to honour@ their word
8456,it was a cold@ reminder of their world of the business they traded@ in@ daily
8457,we had@ a large colony of nazis living in the soviet union
8458,they weren't all scientists in@ fact we had@ littleuse for most of them
8459,they had their own estates and farms to@ the west of moscow
8460,they kept@ their secret identities and paid for it through@ their swiss bank accounts
8461,but they remained germans always dreaming@ of going back to the fatherland one day
8462,how many nazis did you take to russia after@ the war
8463,the narodnyi kommissariat vnutrennikh del our people's commissariat for internal affairs was responsible@ for 
8464,i never heard@ of them the dda stopped@ him
8465,nkvd explained the ddi patronizingly
8466,wiped@ out@ twenty million russians for stalin
8467,that@ right he challenged@ sorge
8468,more
8469,thirty million
8470,according to official sources@ sorge riposted
8471,a most useful organization
8472,that@ should shut them up 
8473,he felt@ the look of disbelief pass@ between@ the exec director and the dda
8474,the other just watched him the mocking smile still on@ his lips
8475,he would be the one rostov had warned him to be wary of
8476,he decided to wipe@ the smile off@ his face
8477,thirty thousand
8478,that@'s how many east germans we deported into the soviet union after@ the war
8479,the ddi's smile disappeared@ 
8480,thirty thousand nazis
8481,jesus
8482,yes
8483,and we kept another hundred and twenty thousand between@ # and # in hitler's old concentration camps
8484,many were nazis but businessmen and professionals were also our targets@ 
8485,a third of those@ died
8486,the others were eventually releasedand absorbed@ into@ the democratic republic
8487,including nazi sympathizers
8488,probably
8489,doesn't that@ concern you
8490,sorge shrugged
8491,not really
8492,i was eight years old at@ the time
8493,it wasn't the answer that the ddi expected and sorge regretted his words
8494,he wasn't here to make@ jokes
8495,the thirty thousand in the soviet union as i said became a community@ in@ their own right
8496,without@ our knowledge over@ the years with@ the use of their money and supportive people in the swiss banks they forged@ contacts@ with@ those@ left behind@ in east germany
8497,they all had@ one dream@ 
8498,to see@ a unified germany
8499,to regain what they had lost@ 
8500,they had@ a code-name amongst@ themselves
8501,something that linked@ them was a reminder of how they had got@ there@ 
8502,it had to be a safe@ name innocuous nothing that would draw@ attention to@ the past
8503,they remembered the lucy network@ their gateway@ out of germany
8504,they called themselves die lucie geister
8505,the lucy@ ghosts@ 
8506,yes
8507,did the organization extend@ to@ america
8508,the exec director was alarmed
8509,how the hell@ did they
8510,goodenache
8511,i guess he was one of them asked the ddi
8512,we weren't sure but in view of his sudden departure i would say yes
8513,which ties@ trimmler in@ 
8514,and god knows who else
8515,the name grob mitzer mean@ anything
8516,he was one of their leaders
8517,it was the lucy ghosts who supplied him with the cash that helped@ him build@ his empire@ 
8518,why didn't you stop@ it
8519,damn it you knew about@ it for long enough snapped@ the exec director
8520,we didn't realize how important it was
8521,we thought they were like any other wartime group nothing more than reminiscences and marching songs
8522,old men remembering their youth
8523,the importance of it didn't surface@ until germany was reunified
8524,and it was only the englishman overhearing the conversation between@ goodenache and trimmler that finally bridged@ the gap@ 
8525,so why should the english guy take offwith the girl
8526,the ddi changed@ the subject@ 
8527,he's not one of us
8528,i suggest you ask@ your allies about@ that@ 
8529,maybe he's just an adventurer
8530,no more
8531,you must have cleared@ him
8532,of course
8533,the exec director didn't want his dirty@ washing@ wrung@ out@ in front of@ this@ russian
8534,was there anything else
8535,only that the gdr east germany as it was is different to@ the west
8536,there are still many there who haven't forgotten the war
8537,their attitude@ is different to@ us
8538,some are still waiting for the war to end
8539,they're a traditional people
8540,many ex-nazis even gestapo working and living normal everyday lives
8541,working for the stasi
8542,the ddi reminded them all of the secret police who had run@ east germany with@ an iron@ fist@ 
8543,some yes
8544,others returned@ to@ the jobs they had@ before@ the war
8545,within@ the new@ germany many of them have become frightened
8546,their secrets are no longer safe@ 
8547,most of all they fear the israelis
8548,is frick one of these@ guys asked the dda remembering the name picked@ up@ by adam in new orleans
8549,no lied sorge
8550,his orders@ were quite specific
8551,don't ratify any names
8552,they didn't want the yanks stumbling@ in@ and screwing@ up@ in@ an attempt to force@ the issue
8553,so what's all this@ got@ to do@ with@ the deaths of our agents continued the dda
8554,we're not sure
8555,except that a lot@ of the information we have both lost@ was about@ the lucy ghosts
8556,link@ that@ with@ trimmler's death goodenache's sudden departure for germany and the mention of the lucy ghosts during their conversation and i think you will agree that@ is the strongest@ lead@ we have@ to follow@ 
8557,nobody spoke for a while then the exec director reopened@ the discussion
8558,has@ moscow any suggestions as to how we should proceed@ 
8559,no replied sorge which was what he'd been told to say
8560,we hoped you would come up with something
8561,i'm sure we will 
8562,can you tell us the names of some of these@ lucy ghosts cut in the ddi
8563,the ones in russia
8564,how high@ up@ the ladder@ did they go@ 
8565,sorge enjoyed his reply
8566,in@ time yes
8567,but i can tell you you're wasting your efforts lookingfor martin bormann in south america
8568,he died twenty years ago
8569,he watched their stunned@ faces across the room
8570,well and truly shafted
8571,they said little after@ that@ and sorge was soon being escorted with nowak down to the underground garage
8572,five minutes later they were on their way back@ to washington
8573,bormann
8574,fucking bormann
8575,they had@ him all the time said an astonished ddi
8576,would'ya believe it
8577,they probably got@ hitler stashed@ away@ too
8578,well it's been a real eye-opener said the exec director
8579,but let's not forget we've still got@ a crisis@ on@ 
8580,find the englishman
8581,that@'s our first priority
8582,find him and see@ what the son@ of a bitch@ is up@ to@ 
8583,the amtrak crescent atlanta georgia
8584,the train pulled out of atlanta station at@ # pm four minutes behind@ schedule
8585,they had slept well eaten well slept again and eventually gotbored with@ the passing@ countryside
8586,adam had insisted they stay in the room and she hadn't found@ a good enough reason to change@ his mind
8587,he was thumbing through usa today for the umpteenth time looking for something he might have missed@ when he heard her giggling
8588,she was in the swivel chair reflected in the window with@ the dark night as a backdrop@ her head angled towards him 
8589,what's so funny he asked pleasantly putting the paper down
8590,you sure know how to give@ a girl a good time
8591,don't i he grinned back@ 
8592,according to all the books a secret agent's life's meant@ to be glamorous@ 
8593,we've spent@ twenty-four hours together and in@ that@ time i've been bitten@ by bugs in a hooker's bed tied up a guy with no legs and stolen his wheelchair stayed cooped up in a train for twelve hours with an attractive man and behaved like a virgin
8594,don't take@ that@ the wrong way@ 
8595,but james bond would've handled@ it differently
8596,he was scottish
8597,i'm english
8598,they prefer the ram@ 'em and bang@ 'em method
8599,we're more sophisticated in our approach@ 
8600,what happens next@ 
8601,in@ which department@ 
8602,in@ the where're-we-going department@ 
8603,to nordhausen
8604,that@'s where trimmler said he would meet goodenache
8605,trimmler's dead
8606,and goodenache's running@ from@ the russians
8607,he can't go back there
8608,from@ what i heard@ germany was still their home@ 
8609,and nordhausen was where they shared@ something special
8610,they wanted to go there
8611,if goodenache's frightened and he wants to hide that's as good a place as any
8612,nordhausen
8613,where is that@ 
8614,central germany
8615,south of berlin near what was the old@ east-west border@ 
8616,an industrial town
8617,it was also where the nazis built most of their rockets the v# and v# during the second world war
8618,from@ what i remember they moved most of the rocket manufacture down@ there so that our bombers couldn't get@ to@ them
8619,built the factory right in@ the heart@ of the mountains
8620,used slave labour
8621,i think a lot of people died in@ the making of those@ weapons before they ever got launched and blew@ up@ half of london
8622,why would they want to go back there
8623,who knows
8624,maybe it was a job they never finished 
8625,but they did
8626,those@ guys put@ people into space put@ our people on the moon
8627,that@'s enough for most people
8628,that@ was just their work
8629,and they didn't do it for germany
8630,they did it for their conquerors
8631,you telling me that all those@ scientists spent@ their time in america and couldn't wait to gethome@ 
8632,not all of them
8633,most of them became good americans
8634,and good russians i suppose
8635,but these@ two wanted to go home@ 
8636,they never stopped@ being germans
8637,maybe it's the only thing@ they ever dreamt@ about@ 
8638,weird
8639,is it
8640,to want to go home@ 
8641,all they're after@ is their youth
8642,catching@ up@ with@ what they thought they'd lost@ 
8643,aren't we all
8644,she shrugged and looked thoughtful
8645,penny for them he said
8646,i was uh just being a woman
8647,tell me
8648,thinking of peter
8649,ah
8650,the venerable ex
8651,i know
8652,here's us heading@ for trouble and god knows what else and in@ the middle@ of you talking about@ nordhausen i start thinking of peter
8653,wondering what the hell@ he's up@ to@ 
8654,the emotional@ mind of a woman
8655,stop@ knocking@ yourself
8656,makes@ a change@ 
8657,i usually leave@ that@ to@ you
8658,he burst out laughing
8659,ok tough@ guy
8660,what's got you so tickled
8661,here we are crammed@ in a small compartment in a train hurtling across america being chased@ bythe cia the fbi and god knows who else and you're worried about@ your ex-husband's sex life
8662,christ he must've been good
8663,he was a shit@ 
8664,so why
8665,adam stopped@ and shook his head
8666,because some of us like shits@ 
8667,don't ask me why
8668,she laughed with him
8669,he's cheap too
8670,he once bought me a louis vuitton handbag
8671,your travel case reminded@ me of it when we left the hotel
8672,it was for our second anniversary
8673,i broke the lock and took it back to the shop in la jolla
8674,they told me it was a fake
8675,a fucking hong kong fake
8676,can you believe that@ 
8677,what did he say
8678,that he'd bought it in new york when he was there on@ a visit
8679,and if he could remember where the shop was he'd go back and sue the bastards@ 
8680,that@'s peter for you
8681,a cheapskate liar and womanizer
8682,and i can't let him go@ 
8683,that@'s really pathetic news
8684,isn't it
8685,no
8686,just human
8687,very understanding
8688,what would you know
8689,maybe not women but my parents
8690,and my twin brother
8691,you're a twin
8692,was
8693,they all died when i was nine
8694,you said they were out of the country
8695,that you had@ guardians
8696,we all have@ things@ to hide@ 
8697,was he an identical twin
8698,yes
8699,that@ means@ you came from the same egg
8700,that@ right
8701,something like that@ 
8702,he in@ his usual stoical manner didn't tell her that he had studiously learnt everything about@ twins and their relationships
8703,i had@ a boyfriend in@ high school
8704,he was a twin and his brother played on@ the football team@ 
8705,if he got hurt my guy used to suffer too
8706,we used to watch the game together and i'd suddenly see him wince in@ pain
8707,just like that@ 
8708,and i'd look on the field and it was his brother who'd been tackled
8709,yes
8710,something like that@ 
8711,he laughed
8712,i remember once getting a tap roundthe head from my dad
8713,i'd done something wrong
8714,i remember him saying it was a shame that he had to punish us both when only one of us was being naughty
8715,that@ tap sorted@ us both out@ 
8716,do you still feel@ he's with@ you 
8717,he is
8718,then you're lucky
8719,you're not alone
8720,is that@ so bad

9748,there's only twelve with a last week weren't there

9752,ann even if they do some 
9753,i bet@ you feel like a now give them in when they can't truss them dunno 
9754,that i've only had
9755,we give them in when they came@ trussed with though we had before@ 
9756,it's not very heavy@ really to start a truss that's 
9757,well with@ the two lines@ going@ yeah would have been about@ right then but see@ john i don't suppose he realised ann was gonna fetch all the people out of here there and everywhere and start@ that@ up@

9760,ann
9761,no

9907,words that people are using i've got now so i don't even think of it it's just there and i just talk normal that@'s the idea really and if anybody asks you what you're doing then you tell them and it and you say if you don't wish to be on@ it well
9908,wipe@ it off but nobody knows who you are anyway so what difference does it make@ 
9909,unless it got personal i'd turn it off i mean i mean when we went the estate agents and solicitors 
9910,be alan be alan whicker 
9911,sort of sit there putting@ what the solicitor said in your 
9912,turn them off
9913,or if anybody told me i mean i wouldn't and talking in@ confidence about@ their private life or 
9914,no 
9915,just turn them off and that@'s it just normal conversations the words that people use in@ common@ different areas of the country with@ accents and dialect and one thing@ and another it's for the oxford english dictionary the next@ edition
9916,it is very old 
9917,i'm more than happy with@ something like that@ 
9918,do we second hand suite second hand suite the whole lot
9919,it's that 
9920,we go@ for a second hand suite as well or 
9921,a microwave
9922,go@ for a microwave or do you just go@ for
9923,we've got nine hundred pounds approximately after@ the cooker and the fridge
9924,five hundred pound for carpets leaves@ four hundred pound two hundred pound for suite and the microwave 
9925,say@ there's so many combinations that@'s the thing@ isn't it
9926,yep
9927,there are so many combinations of what to have what to get what we can't get what we need really i think is what we need is obviously going to be priority isn't it
9928,yes
9929,carpets cooker fridge
9930,yeah
9931,they're the definite needs and erm 
9932,that@ was eleven hundred pounds
9933,approximately you've got four hundred pound really to play@ with@ approximately four hundred pound left over say@ five hundred pound six hundred for electrical goods
9934,pardon
9935,seven hundred did you say oh no two seventy nine and three twenty something weren't it
9936,yep
9937,er three two
9938,about@ six hundred
9939,six hundred yeah
9940,six hundred for them two and five hundred for carpets
9941,eleven you've got four hundred pound you got so it's a good second hand one or a cheapy no well it would be a cheapy i told him most of them around@ about@ seven hundred and ninety nine 
9942,decent@ 
9943,a reasonable@ one i mean you can go@ up@ two thousand for a good one but a reasonable@ one you wouldn't get nowadays under@ seven hundred and ninety nine 
9944,i think you'd be better off@ with a with a new cooker and fridge
9945,oh yeah definitely i think 
9946, you can go@ second hand 
9947,rather than go@ second 
9948,but er you know er at least if you go@ in@ there@ at least you've got
9949,got@ 
9950,got@ a guarantee for six months 
9951,yeah yeah but 
9952,but at least you know you're going to get@ a decent@ amount of 
9953,two or three years on@ the others
9954,as with a new one you'll probably gonna get@ four five six seven 
9955,i don't like just i couldn't be like deirdre and put me overall on and in go in without@ collecting@ me thoughts getting@ myself together@ deirdre never arrives till about@ three minutes before@ she gets in the door she's putting her overall onsaying come@ on@ ladies its time were but she's putting her overall and on and they all sit there looking at her and so

9959,pardon
9960,put@ them off@ today's
9961,i know but it's just waste@ of time in@ it they'd been better spent@ to finish the order@ that they did have@ and inject@ that@ ha oh be fair@ to do that@ to use though no doubt they will pick out all the things we didn't do right bloody should done too many of this@ or not enough of that@

10317,if you wanna take@ it that@ way@ 
10318,if if labour say get@ in@ 
10319,if labour get@ in@ and they can't fulfil their promises
10320,yes
10321,like john smith's made@ promises then that conservatives haven't done this@ that@ and the other@ he must be able to do them now mustn't he
10322,who must
10323,john smith
10324,well erm they they don't know whether they can do it or not do they 
10325,no but he's criticizing the conservative policies and all that@ and what we will do is this@ 
10326,i know for@ investment
10327,yes but they all say that@ 
10328,industry 
10329,don't they until they get@ into@ power@ 
10330,i know
10331,and and then they all 
10332,they do
10333,back down
10334,they do
10335,yeah
10336,they'll say they they probably haven't got@ the finances to back@ up@ what they what they said they would do
10337,yeah but a a lot@ of quotes gonna be made@ to@ them after@ aren't there
10338,you know like you said this@ and you haven't done it you said that@ and you haven't done it and all that@ sort of 
10339,yes but once they're in@ power@ there's nothing you 
10340,well 
10341,can do about@ it
10342,oh admittedly no
10343,no
10344,but they must feel@ a bit stupid to er
10345,well i can't well i mean there's an awful lot@ i mean would no no matter which political party it is they all make@ promises but they don't carry them all out
10346,no
10347,course not
10348,but i mean these@ are these@ are major things@ 
10349,getting@ the economy right
10350,now john smith
10351,but er well john may have 
10352,we'll get@ the economy right
10353,now if he doesn't get@ the economy right he's gonna end up with@ egg@ on@ his face@ and
10354,of course he is
10355,but you tell me how just how is he going to do it
10356,i mean ee they don't explain to@ you how they're going to do it do they
10357,no
10358,they they just come out er
10359,with statements 
10360,glibly with these@ these@ statements 
10361,mm
10362,mm
10363,i'm sure that if there is an easy way@ of doing it the conservatives would have found out and done it
10364,i don't think there's any any easy way@ 
10365,i don't see@ how they're going to do it
10366,no

10368,i mean where are they going where are they going to get@ the extra money from@ er to pay for the old aged pensioners' er eight pound rise@ 
10369,mm
10370,or so they say we'll get@ eight pound

10586,no
10587,she's always been active all her life 
10588,all been active all her life
10589,no you can't understand how these@ things@ happen
10590,well they give@ you all these@ bloody@ tips@ and papers about@ what to do to avoid@ this@ and avoid@ that@ 
10591,and what to eat and everything but 
10592,this@ bloody@ footballer i mean it's a 
10593,i know 
10594,a really fit man
10595,i know
10596,he's er one artery was seventy percent blocked it was in@ the paper
10597,yeah
10598,and the other artery was ninety percent blocked
10599,was it really
10600,yeah
10601,yeah
10602,good god
10603,i mean he could have gone@ any time 
10604,graham sounness i mean he's only thirty eight
10605,could have gone@ any time with@ with@ nothing through his bloody@ arteries
10606,good god
10607,but that@'s i didn't know it was that@ bad
10608,it was in@ the paper this@ morning
10609,and er 
10610,goodness me
10611,well he's a he he didn't smoke
10612,no
10613,he was an athlete
10614,he's been an athlete
10615,he obviously ate like everybody else
10616,mm
10617,and he 
10618,i mean 
10619,wasn't overweight in@ any way@ 
10620,wasn't overweight what more 
10621,no 
10622,the bloody@ hell@ do you have to do
10623,that@'s incredible that@ 
10624,see@ they say it was a it's hereditary
10625,well
10626,cos his father had@ a bypass didn't he
10627,oh did he
10628,i think some other relative died er 
10629,oh 
10630,youngish
10631,yes
10632,oh well i bet@ i think perhaps it is really
10633,i know
10634,it's still going@ 
10635,i know
10636,yeah and you can't you can't understand it can you really
10637,well look@ at@ the old lady that walks past here at@ ninety one
10638,that@'s right yeah
10639,yeah
10640,and she does all her own shopping
10641,mm
10642,you know i mean she keeps stopping but she's she's remarkable
10643,she really is
10644,mm
10645,but they're few@ and far@ between@ aren't they
10646,when you're like that@ 
10647,yeah
10648,mm
10649,but what i couldn't understand with@ this@ this@ fella that
10650,this@ sounness
10651,aye
10652,he he found out cos he went for@ to for@ a check up and they took@ his blood pressure
10653,yes
10654,and well lots@ of people go and have blood pressure taken@ they find@ it's high@ and they 
10655,yes 
10656,give them tablets
10657,yes
10658,go home
10659,why did they take@ it a stage@ further@ with@ him
10660,he'd got@ high@ blood pressure he wasn't in@ any pain he's living a normal life
10661,similar to@ what i was when i went
10662,yes
10663,and they just give me tablets
10664,yes
10665,now why what made@ them take@ it to@ the stage@ 
10666,well er well first 
10667,where he wanted a heart bypass 
10668,first and foremost he was in@ a private scheme
10669,well probably that@'s it then
10670,yeah
10671,and probably because because of his father and er the the other relative having@ the bypasses done
10672,so they took@ it 
10673,mm 
10674,a step@ further@ but i think probably it's because he was in@ er er a private scheme
10675,very likely innit
10676,yes
10677,so there's a lot@ of people walking about@ with@ just taking bloody@ tablets who probably really should have@ a bypass
10678,ah well i well i wouldn't say that@ really gordon
10679,i mean i think er when your blood pressure was found out and you'd been taking tablets ever so i think it's kept@ it all under@ control and you've you we eat a sensible diet
10680,the only the only er thing@ i complained about@ with@ you is is the butter
10681,mm
10682,i don't have that@ much now 
10683,but i think everything in@ moderation but you don't eat as much butter now as what you used to
10684,i don't eat that@ much bread you see@ 
10685,no
10686,so i i think really and i think what i think with@ him i think definitely i think it must be the private scheme and plus that his own family it runs@ in@ the family
10687,mm mm
10688,must be hell@ of a shock@ being told
10689,oh god
10690,it must have been
10691,see@ how much it's costing
10692,two hundred and fifty pounds a night
10693,yeah
10694,phworgh
10695,that@'s without@ the operation
10696,yeah
10697,well he earned three hundred and fifty thousand a year then
10698,oh i know
10699,and plus he's he he he he married an heiress you know
10700,did he
10701,er him er they live in spain now
10702,oh er he he's worth a pretty@ penny@ is sounness
10703,he went in carl's shop the other the otherweek
10704,did he
10705,yes
10706,mm
10707,must have been looking for@ a house
10708,carl said he he looked er well er his face did it were very he's gota very poxy skin
10709,has he 
10710,you mm
10711,yes
10712,he was having@ it done this@ afternoon weren't he
10713,yeah
10714,some time today
10715,aye
10716,i tell you what that@'s quick@ int it though gordon
10717,with@ only going in last night and
10718,mm
10719,having@ it done today
10720,it is indeed
10721,i wonder how quick@ they would have got him in though if he wouldn't have been in@ a private scheme
10722,he could wait six months couldn't he
10723,well he could have been dead by@ then
10724,well er yeah exactly that@'s what they're moaning about@ int it
10725,terrible
10726,put@ them on@ a list and wait
10727,i've never heard so much talk about@ health as we do nowadays
10728,oh i know
10729,when i was young i i don't remember talking all the time about@ bloody@ health and what you should do and what you shouldn't do
10730,no i know
10731,did you
10732,no
10733,but we weren't educated in@ in@ in@ health though 
10734,we just we just lived and that@ was the end@ of it
10735,yes but then you see@ in@ the in@ the old@ days gordon i mean you you were very fortunate if you got three meals a day and and whatever you got you were glad of and used to eat it all
10736,now we're much more affluent and people are educated er
10737,mm
10738,as regards their health
10739,mhm
10740,well having said that@ gordon your mother lived to@ a good old@ age and my mum and my father did
10741,yeah
10742,and they ate all the wrong stuff didn't they 
10743,according to according to what they say now they did 
10744,mm
10745,i know
10746,don't know who to believe really
10747,when you look@ at@ when you look@ at@ the some all these@ a lot@ of these@ composers and artists who died long ago and you look@ the birth range@ there's a hell@ of a lot@ at@ seventy five seventy six
10748,yes
10749,oh there's a few at@ forty odd@ 
10750,mm
10751,but there's a hell@ of a lot@ well into@ their seventies

12008,not bad 
12009,oh we'll do this one again 
12010,drop off 
12011,cos it's lights and things isn't it
12012,she was looking at er lights in sainsbury's the other day
12013,it looked like that@ didn't it
12014,carol was swaying at her
12015,you missed that@ 
12016,i just swayed at her and she 
12017,it's conway twitty isn't it
12018,is it
12019,oh no
12020,how far@ back@ does this go@ i suppose early fifties
12021,er nineteen fifty six
12022,i remember conway twitty
12023,oh yes
12024,you were in your cradle
12025,elvis didn't he 
12026,i don't think he ever recorded it i think he just used to sing it at@ his er sort of cabaret
12027,well so many of these@ songs have been done by so many people that you would be forgiven for thinking that that
12028,because there's one there one on one of these that er either paul simon or art garfunkel or someone can't remember which one probably art garfunkel as paul simon does all his own doesn't he
12029,well he has done other people's
12030,well there's one on there i can't remember
12031,like for instance the er what do they call those@ two
12032,oh the two brothers
12033,in@ the
12034,everley brothers
12035,the everley brothers that@'s it
12036,you know wake up little suzie
12037,oh yeah
12038,well simon and garfunkel did that@ 
12039,wicked@ far out
12040,it's a groovy record this 
12041,shut up 
12042,can't remember which one it is but i'll recognise it when i hear it
12043,he's doing very well isn't he
12044,he is
12045,have to employ him full time
12046,he's always quite good
12047,i just can't believe how daft he is
12048,i suppose you like that@ film 
12049,yes 
12050,forget it
12051,you're not having cake
12052,does she like cake
12053,well she's looking at it 
12054,so how's things@ down@ at the 
12055,not too bad 
12056,quite good actually 
12057,yeah
12058,keeping him busy out on@ estimates and
12059,yeah he's out all this@ week
12060,well my dad won't pass@ them onto@ terry
12061,me dad said he's had@ enough well we were debating whether to give@ it to@ you or not
12062,but i thought well if terry notices he might 
12063,well in@ fact two really big@ estimates 
12064,who terry
12065,yeah
12066,and one wanted@ re-estimating the other one wanted@ a few more prices cos everything like marble tops which are going to cost a fortune to get done
12067,we give@ them a provisional kind of price and not really gone@ into@ it in@ detail@ 
12068,so she had a list of about@ five things@ she wanted sorted@ out@ and she said so far@ we were the cheapest
12069,but she's got@ about@ six different firms on the computer and was comparing notes
12070,so i worked out and the other two were really fitting and electrics and it was all down@ to@ terry to sort@ those@ out@ 
12071,and they're both about@ two to@ three thousand pounds worth of sanitary ware or more but two to@ three thousand pounds worth of work
12072,well you can't afford to lose@ them can you
12073,no
12074,so what's going to happen then
12075,god knows
12076,he said i asked asked well i left a message on@ saturday for him to sort@ them out@ didn't i
12077,he already knew about@ that@ 
12078,and then i asked my father on@ tuesday to remind him and he said he'd already said he'd fetch@ them in@ on@ tuesday
12079,and he my father reminded him last night and he said yeah he would have@ them by@ tomorrow morning
12080,but he's he just really has to get in touch with one of them and tell them the prices
12081,so i don't know
12082,well i mean he'd done he's done this@ first estimate these@ are all just polishing@ touches@ cos people are obviously interested in@ you know they're well keen@ on@ our prices
12083,they can't pursue@ it till we come back to them
12084,they're not pursuing@ it until we put@ these@ things@ out@ 
12085,my father just turned round i've had@ enough of it if terry's not going to do the estimate he passes@ them on to@ brian
12086,i said yeah then i get@ into@ trouble with@ them for not passing@ estimates to@ terry and then there's an argument
12087,if he if he says anything to@ me i'll just have to tell him
12088,but he's not doing the estimates he's been given@ and he can't afford to throw@ money away@ 
12089,it's cos he's working for him at@ the moment money
12090,he always gets like that@ and then he forgets after@ like a month or two when he hasn't worked for him
12091,he forgets how annoying he can be and you know he swings@ the other way@ 
12092,i mean brian's pulled in a lot@ of work
12093,lot@ of people kind of saying come back again on@ thursday so he's he's 
12094,if we got@ terry to do that@ we'd be well away@ 
12095,they they would love him i mean one of them it was annoying really cos terry's just not pulling@ his weight@ 
12096,i don't understand it if i live to be a hundred i won't understand it
12097,and also it's cos that you know after we had@ that@ row about@ terry after@ bank holiday expecting not to have to do a day in the shop and er he's already owing brian a day
12098,guess who's doing the extra day got@ my dad to cover@ a day
12099,and then he takes@ a day off@ bank holidays
12100,and he can't do it because my dad 
12101,but then tomorrow he's actually doing his own work
12102,so he could easily have 
12103,and on@ monday 
12104,so who's covering@ tomorrow
12105,well my brother's covered@ practically all week and brian's doing tomorrow
12106,terry phoned up asking what tuesday morning about@ quarter past@ eight said who was covering@ 
12107,and he said well my father is doing today i can't do today i'll do it friday and i shouted down the stairs but he owes you a day you shouldn't be going in
12108,i mean he hasn't been in the shop once this@ week
12109,somebody's got to tell him to 
12110,so do dave and terry in the shop 
12111,they have the records 
12112,and it hasn't been sorted@ yet
12113,oh no
12114,he's got@ the gall@ to phone up on@ tuesday and say eileen can't do a day we're going to be short@ of eileen
12115,so the answer@ is to just phone them
12116,i can't do it
12117,i'm not doing it 
12118,what's the point@ of carrying on like that@ 
12119,well he's going to carry on like that@ isn't he
12120,not unless someone puts@ their foot@ down@

12425,and then two 
12426,and two times four is eight
12427,erm i didn't write it like that then 
12428,right
12429,share@ the total of fives
12430,yeah i done yeah i done 
12431,er 
12432,five five five is fifteen 
12433,five add@ five add@ five
12434,erm is fifteen
12435,and then erm 
12436,right
12437,is fifteen
12438,and then 
12439,and sixes 
12440,sixes six 
12441,
12442,add@ six add@ six 
12443,add@ six 
12444,add@ six
12445,is thirty six
12446,right
12447,six times six is thirty 
12448,i've done that one 
12449,sixes
12450,that@'s it
12451,okay
12452,erm this
12453,i'll leave that out 
12454,leave that out

12457,that much closer can use those pictures
12458,take@ a look
12459,are they near the box
12460,yeah
12461,is that@ right
12462,four 
12463,four is twenty
12464,so it's four so
12465,four times five is
12466,twenty
12467,four times five equal twenty
12468,er two times six equals twelve
12469,er four times three equal twelve
12470,er two additions@ left@ 
12471,alright
12472,those two add@ 
12473,so it's like one two one two and one there and but put like erm seven add@ seven add@ seven is 
12474,is twenty one
12475,yeah
12476,seven add@ seven add@ seven is twenty one 
12477,one 
12478,and three times seven
12479,right
12480,is twenty one and do it that@ way@ five and fives
12481,okay
12482,two addition@ questions 
12483,hang@ on@ 
12484,two yeah but you've got right two multiple and two addition@ equations
12485,not equations
12486,you told us this@ 
12487,but like these these are equations
12488,so two addition@ equations er three times seven plus seven plus seven is twenty one
12489,right
12490,oh
12491,so but you can also go@ 
12492,yeah
12493,yeah add@ three 
12494,three plus three plus three plus three plus three plus three is twenty one
12495,do it that@ way@ on@ 
12496,do you follow@ 
12497,yeah 
12498,me
12499,yes i do
12500,right
12501,two multiplication 
12502,yeah
12503,and two addition@ 
12504,two addition@ 
12505,right
12506,so you like you 
12507,yes that@'s right
12508,then it's like erm 
12509,one 
12510,seven times three and three times seven 
12511,and three times seven
12512,that@'s right
12513,and you do the same there 
12514,same on@ the adds@ 
12515,and then this we do like
12516,right she wants currency in@ two divisions@ in@ each right
12517,so it's one two three four 
12518,that multiplication is a 
12519,yeah well divisions@ okay so it's twenty one shared@ by say if that's one two three four five six int it
12520,oh i know what i've got@ 
12521,six times three is eighteen or three times six is eighteen
12522,i know what i've done
12523,i've put the i thought it was er okay
12524,six
12525,and division@ is shared@ by 
12526,so you got to do eighteen shared@ by six is three and eighteen
12527,have you got
12528,shared@ by three is six
12529,so like you go@ one two three four five six six times you swap@ 
12530,three 
12531,six times three 
12532,times three is eighteen 
12533,is three times six 
12534,six
12535,yeah and and you got 
12536,six times three and three times six 
12537,and division@ is eighteen shared@ by three is six and eighteen shared@ by six is three
12538,yeah
12539,got@ it
12540,i cannot read 
12541,three sixes are eighteen
12542,you got@ it
12543,and you do the same there
12544,hang@ on@ 
12545,i haven't finished thirty three 
12546,one yet
12547,that@'s what i don't get@ 
12548,why do multiplication equation for this similar line@ i don't get@ how you do that@ 
12549,is it would you like us to put
12550,it's fours int it
12551,it's fours 
12552,no two four six eight ten twelve
12553,yeah
12554,it 
12555,that's twos
12556,no but it's going@ to@ fours look
12557,it's going@ to@ fours
12558,alright
12559,going@ into@ fours
12560,what would i put@ 
12561,er one four is four two fours are eight and three fours is twelve
12562,as this is been shared@ by lines@ int it
12563,yeah and it's on@ that one
12564,you do it like that@ do you
12565,yeah cos it's being shared@ by 
12566,oh
12567,so it's i would say that is er nine times four equals thirty six
12568,and on@ that one is er sixty three shared@ by nine six time sixty three divided@ by nine
12569,four
12570,no
12571,sixty three divided@ by nine is six
12572,write six through it
12573,ten six innit
12574,no it's ten sixes
12575,no no wait a minute
12576,nines
12577,what should nine times ten emma 
12578,one nine is nine two nines are eighteen three nines are
12579,twenty seven
12580,four nines are thirty six five nines are forty five six nines fifty four seven nine are sixty three
12581,oh thank you
12582,right
12583,yeah seven nines are sixty three
12584,hang@ on@ a minute
12585,six nines are
12586,seven nines are sixty three
12587,hang@ on@ a minute
12588,seven
12589,seven nines are sixty three 
12590,sixty three 
12591,yeah
12592,you work them out like that look
12593,yeah
12594,well seven nines well ee er it takes@ you so long 
12595,look one one nine is nine
12596,yeah
12597,two nines are eighteen
12598,so that one there is sixes into@ thirty six 
12599,i know

13286,mm
13287,it could well have been 
13288,but mum it's a bit late from@ that@ 
13289,well it's always takes@ a long@ time

13529,it's a bit bigger than our ford escort
13530,it won't mummy
13531,i don't think it will
13532,if it doesn't mum anyway it wouldn't fit in the garage because there's another car in there 
13533,oh that@'s a point@ 
13534,that@'s a bit tricky
13535,well we think that that@ might be a new car
13536,yeah we think it's 
13537,
13538,cos we're nearly there 
13539,we're not nearly there 
13540,we haven't even started 
13541,nearly there 
13542,got to be quick 
13543,did you actually go@ to@ sleep mummy
13544,i did
13545,did you 
13546,i was absolutely whacked out@ 
13547,you've done very well 
13548,well i haven't
13549,you've done all the meals 
13550,dad could you walk it to macdonalds
13551,well you could
13552,it would be a little bit far for us
13553,but we could if we needed to
13554,wouldn't be too bad cos you'd go down@ by the jolly farmer
13555,yeah
13556,you'd have to walk like gemma walks to school wouldn't you
13557,mm
13558,where does gemma live
13559,gemma lives 
13560,yeah near macdonalds
13561,near macdonalds dad
13562,she lives right near macdonalds doesn't she
13563,she does actually
13564,wonder if she goes to macdonalds every night for her tea
13565,no
13566,but she could walk it from her house couldn't she
13567,she could 
13568,because it's not far
13569,yeah all she has to do is go go round her bit round just a normal road across the road down@ a little@ bit@ and she's there 
13570,mm
13571,it's not very far daddy is it daddy
13572,a teeny@ bit@ 
13573,it's only round the corner from her isn't it mum
13574,it's only 
13575,i found it over here
13576,i can't see it
13577,there it is
13578,there it is
13579,there's a lot@ of people there
13580,do you think we'll get a seat
13581,ooh there's a lot@ of cars
13582,i see macdonalds
13583,there's not normally that@ many people there are there
13584,no
13585,it's
13586,what
13587,it's a bit full
13588,oh it looks crowded
13589,perhaps there's a party 
13590,it's not a party 
13591,perhaps there's only one person in each car at macdonalds
13592,that@'s true@

13753,are we inviting anyone
13754,i know we're not inviting anybody for lunch christmas day couldn't cope with@ that@ but it would be quite to have them in@ the afternoon can't cope with@ the people
13755,oh yeah
13756,suppose we should do something yeah
13757,well that@'s what i was thinking perhaps we could go with somebody somewhere
13758,you know like by a canal or something
13759,perhaps well if it's snowing it won't be quite the same 
13760,that@'s right 
13761,conducive to@ tripping@ about
13762,but if it's quite nice weather it would be nice to invite somebody along i expect 
13763,they could just 
13764,stratford
13765,yeah the stratford warriors running@ about@ every six weeks something like that@ 
13766,is it six weeks since we saw the last one then

13785,really

13787,tesco's are probably cheaper
13788,you remember that@ tom and jerry i got for tim

13816,monday
13817,are you
13818,oh well 
13819,so that@ fits@ in@ quite well i couldn't remember what i was doing on@ monday but we said sort of tentatively monday would be probably quite a good day i think
13820,better than thursday anyway
13821,so could tuesday night be inspector morse night
13822,yeah cos my mum will be here then
13823,oh right can we not take her home 
13824,unpaid 
13825,well she'll 
13826,we shall see@ 
13827,have been here all day won't she
13828,so she might want to go home 
13829,she wants to tell us all about@ her wedding 
13830,could you tell her we're going to watch inspector morse 
13831,for the third or fourth time
13832,will she have watched inspector morse
13833,she won't of watched it cos it's bound@ to be on@ a wednesday night
13834,does she like inspector morse
13835,i don't think she watches it normally
13836,no she probably doesn't like it
13837,a bit spicy@ 
13838,i bet@ she would she loves anything like that@ 
13839,bit@ of a body@ 
13840,mind you it might be too complicated
13841,it was i remember reading in@ the paper that it's been it's been filmed at a house which no one's ever been allowed to go in even the great@ sort of one of these@ country mansions it was not 
13842,right
13843,and even people who write about@ 
13844,if it was not it can't be again they're always going in there 
13845,well that@'s fine@ 
13846,it was some country mansion in oxfordshire you know
13847,mm
13848,it's as you come off the 
13849,and how did 
13850,and 
13851,they get@ permission then
13852,they somehow managed@ to persuade the owners apparently it was and it was and nobody else had ever been allowed in this@ place not even erm historians who write about@ famous buildings even they had been refused access
13853,where is it
13854,somewhere in oxfordshire
13855,oh
13856,they don't know where
13857,oh 
13858,so
13859,this@ was about@ last week's episode
13860,i think it was about@ last week's but they seem to imply that it was last week's episode that would
13861,oh
13862,do@ it
13863,we seem to have got one spare video if we don't get it watched before@ wednesday
13864,alright
13865,well that@'s the only chance
13866,oh yeah cos we're going to maryland tomorrow
13867,your dad
13868,mm
13869,erm not it wasn't about@ your dad it was about@ my birthday cos 
13870,cos 
13871,he'd realized that it was my birthday and what did i want
13872,so i said send me a cheque and i'll go and shop
13873,and
13874,and last week cos she's quite generous isn't she
13875,she is a bit but it's 
13876,no i didn't say anything 
13877,i think that@'s the thing@ 
13878,so your dad sent a cheque
13879,anyway i asked her if she'd heard from your dad and she has heard from your dad apparently on@ friday he went to the consultant
13880,mm
13881,and next@ week he's got@ his first well she didn't know whether it was radiotherapy or chemotherapy
13882,and she said he has to go trotting@ to exeter two or three times a week now
13883,mm
13884,i don't know how long it's going to go@ on@ for or what it is exactly but i thought it would be a good idea to ring your dad up and see@ 
13885,mm
13886,but at least things@ have moved@ and at least they've gone round 
13887,so i'm pleased really are you
13888,interesting that they've done it so quickly@ isn't it
13889,after@ seeing him because he thought that once he'd seen the consultant it would then take@ some time to get the treatment started but they must have got@ themselves over@ that@ 
13890,yeah
13891,well i mean everyone 
13892,yeah
13893,i think 
13894,gotta get@ moving@ 
13895,and presumably whatever it was the gp had give him has had upset@ that@ thrombosis again
13896,i don't know whether to ring him tonight oh it's too late tonight now 
13897,it's much too late
13898,perhaps we could ring tomorrow afternoon when the children are up@ 
13899,well they love talking to@ them on@ the phone don't they
13900,i know they do
13901,we could can prime@ them up@ on@ what to say and types of things@ to talk about@ so they don't get moaned down@ or something 
13902,bogged@ down@ 
13903,so he's had to go in what did you say
13904,three times a week
13905,i don't know she just said 
13906,something like that@ 
13907,a few times a week and i think it sounded like three cos she was wondering how he would cope with@ driving and everything
13908,mm a trial
13909,well i hope not i mean no he won't be able to drive 
13910,but presumably your mum can do that@ for they've got@ hundreds of people there he's always driving people everywhere 
13911,that@'s right 
13912,so i don't see@ why they can't drive him
13913,i'm sure they will 
13914,yes 
13915,cos they're very good aren't they
13916,i mean look@ at@ that@ woman doing her er from the from the church
13917,at@ times like this@ it would be nice if we lived nearer could help out 
13918,it would nice if we lived there but we can't so 
13919,it's about 
13920,and write as well
13921,yes
13922,double dose 
13923,yes
13924,and pulled out 
13925,well it's sort of pulled out but at least it's 
13926,we'll be paying for it as well
13927,and it's hard@ as well
13928,we've been paying anyway so it must of you know
13929,what does erm you see@ er eileen's and she's having@ chemotherapy isn't she
13930,by by medication is 
13931,that@ right
13932,well she takes all these@ tablet things 
13933,that@'s right she has a sort of massive@ dose every now and then
13934,and that@ makes@ her feel@ what
13935,she's not in@ pain is she
13936,more sort of dopey
13937,i wouldn't care if they made@ me dazed 
13938,yeah 
13939,
13940,yeah
13941,i dunno
13942,not gonna 
13943,difficult to know 
13944,oh yes that@ was it
13945,i wonder how bad it is that@ feeling's like we don't really know how bad it is do we
13946,no
13947,perhaps he will be able to say you know
13948,but whether he'd tell us over@ the telephone you think ask
13949,i think he would wouldn't he
13950,i think so
13951,cos we've got@ the agm in@ two weeks time
13952,mm
13953,and we voted all these@ people that are here 
13954,what type of this 
13955,well you just 
13956,it doesn't matter 
13957,you just come along don't you find out 
13958,what we do with@ all the money and you find out who's doing what and who's doing you know
13959,mm
13960,it's it's quite exciting really
13961,if you 
13962,but i've 
13963,these@ little@ things@ 
13964,you couldn't show me something 
13965,alright

14207,that i really but i mean last year still not finished 
14208,she's really funny 
14209,so we had@ a laugh well said he when he woke up he said day one you can do three on@ one day 
14210,mind you she's like that@ better get 
14211,when you're feeling@ keen@ i said you can do a lot@ and then

14223, she did it

14225,but as they do it's gonna hit@ her cos it's not year that it doesn't help@ see if she's in@ a third year class she was always as she is now in@ the top@ of that@ but even 
14226,that@'s right 
14227,when she was only a second year therefore that@ means@ she's not given@ enough work but i mean 
14228,i know what you mean
